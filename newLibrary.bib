With Canada's population living longer, along with the anticipated shortage of Canadian workers in the coming decades and the erosion of private sector pensions, the Canadian Institute of Actuaries (CIA) believes that it is time for federal, provincial, and territorial governments to refresh their approach to helping Canadians achieve retirement income security. Canada's retirement income security system is a complex set of interconnected arrangements, including programs funded by individuals, employers, and taxpayers. While there are many possible ways to fine-tune these arrangements, we believe that governments should consider updating retirement ages to reflect the fact that Canadians are already choosing to work past age 65 and the expectation that this trend will increase in the coming years. The CIA wants all parties to understand that later retirement is a reasonable response to longer life expectancies, worker shortages, and lower interest rates. Adjusting retirement ages will foster a growing Canadian economy — we believe Canadian workers need to be nudged in this direction.},

Our main finding is that increases in cultural fractionalization significantly increased output, while increases in cultural polarization significantly decreased output. We address the issue of identifying the causal effects of cultural diversity by using the supply-push component of immigrant inflows as an instrumental variable.},

These measures are being used to estimate economic benefits in every empirical field of economics. Typically, analysis of these data have shown remarkably low direct returns of education for improving subjective well-being. In addition, arguably, the inferred impact of material wealth and income using this method is also unexpectedly low as compared with other, social factors, and as compared with economists' prior expectations which underlie, in some sense, support for using GDP as a proxy for more general quality of life goals. Discrete response scales used ubiquitously for the reporting of life satisfaction pose cognitive challenges to survey respondents, so differing cognitive abilities result in different uses of the scale, and thus potential bias in statistical inference. This problem has so far gone unnoticed. An overlooked feature of the distribution of responses to life satisfaction questions is that they exhibit certain enhancements at focal values, in particular at 0, 5, and 10 on the eleven-point scale. In this paper, I investigate the reasons for, and implications of, these response patterns. I use a model to account for the focal-value behavior using a latent variable approach to capture the "internal" cognitive evaluation before it is translated to the discrete scale of a survey question. This approach, supported by other more heuristic ones, finds a significant upward correction for the effects of both education and income on life satisfaction.}

  abstract = {BACKGROUND Pressures to keep immigration rates at relatively high levels are likely to persist in most developed countries. At the same time, immigrant cohorts are becoming more and more diverse, leading host societies to become increasingly heterogeneous across multiple dimensions. For scholars who study demographic or socio-economic behaviours, the need to account for ethno-cultural “super-diversity” brings new challenges. OBJECTIVE The main objective of this paper is to present a framework for the prospective analysis of super-diversity in several high immigration countries. METHODS We developed microsimulation models that simultaneously project several population dimensions for Canada, the United States and countries of the European Union, with the aim of studying the consequences of alternate future population and migration trends. RESULTS The paper presents the projected progression of three indicators of diversity: percentage of foreign-born population, percentage of the population using a non-official language at home and percentage of non-Christians. It also examines the projected changes in the labour force by education levels and language. Using alternative scenarios, we also show that the proportion of highly educated in the US and EU28 labour force could increase by 11 and 15 percentage points respectively if future immigrants were selected as in Canada. Finally, the paper proposes a new longitudinal indicator that counts the number of years lived as active and inactive over the life course for foreign- and native-born cohorts. CONTRIBUTION The microsimulation models provide much more informative results than more traditional cohort-component models to study the future effects of ethno-cultural superdiversity on high immigration countries., No.},

Results of the microsimulation show that Canada's labor force population will continue to increase, but at a slower rate than in the recent past. By 2031, almost one third of the country's total labor force could be foreign-born, and almost all its future increase is expected to be among university graduates, while the less-educated labor force is projected to decline.},

  abstract = {This book is a practical, step-by-step introduction to microsimulation in demography. It shows how to use Modgen, a powerful and free microsimulation platform built by Statistics Canada. The authors' hands-on explanation of model development will help readers make their own. The book teaches how to create and run a simple cohort model with a single fixed-rate event, and builds upon this concept. It introduces how to develop both a single state life table as well as a multiple increment-decrement life table using the tools provided by Modgen. The authors illustrate how to easily upgrade an existing model by adding new modules and new dimensions as determinants of a risk already modeled. The integration of a fertility module and a base population allows the user to bring new actors into the simulation and transform a cohort-based model into a population-based one. The final addition of an international migration module allows the user to accomplish fully open, multi-regional projections. This accessible introduction will be of interest to researchers and students in population studies and other social sciences. It will also appeal to anyone interested in the computational modeling of population dynamics.},

In this paper we explore possible explanations for the behaviour of the UK labour market during the period of the recession. We establish that there has been significant underemployment, which partly explains the sluggish increase in unemployment, but also means that (i) significant numbers of workers are supplying fewer hours of work than they would like and (ii) when recovery comes, profit maximising employers are likely to increase the hours of existing workers, rather than making new hires. This particularly disadvantages the young. Our new analysis points to significant levels of underemployment among younger age groups - whether this is measured in relation to their actual hours of work, their desired hours of work, or their labour force participation.}

With the introduction of the Quarterly Labour Force Survey since 2008, a newly derived variable, namely underemployed, has become available.

However, underemployment could also be derived according to the ‘inadequate employment situations’ approach (e.g. under-utilisation of skills, over-qualification).

  abstract = {Bien que la relation entre l’état de santé perçu et les mesures de santé physique et mentale soit bien documentée dans les pays développés, très peu d’études ont examiné cette association dans le monde en développement, particulièrement en Afrique subsaharienne. De même, les études menées dans divers contextes sociaux ont documenté que les femmes et les personnes de plus faible statut socioéconomique (SSÉ) sont les plus susceptibles de porter un lourd fardeau des incapacités et de la mauvaise santé perçue, mais il n’est pas connu si ces associations existent aussi dans les pays africains. L'objectif général de cette recherche doctorale était d’aboutir à une meilleure compréhension de la stratification sociale de la santé en Afrique subsaharienne. Plus spécifiquement, cette étude visait à: 1) Examiner les associations entre la santé perçue et les mesures de santé physique et mentale (maladies chroniques, incapacités et dépression) parmi les adultes à Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso, et évaluer comment ces associations varient selon le sexe, le niveau d’éducation et l'âge; 2) Analyser les différences en matière d’incapacité cognitive et physique entre les hommes et les femmes âgés de 50 ans et plus à Ouagadougou et évaluer la mesure dans laquelle les différences observées pourraient être attribuables aux inégalités de genre en matière de conditions sociales et de santé à travers le cycle de vie; 3) Examiner la relation entre le SSÉ et une multitude de mesures d’incapacités parmi les adultes âgés de 18 ans et plus dans 18 pays d’Afrique subsaharienne et déterminer si les différences socioéconomiques dans les incapacités sont caractérisées par une divergence, convergence ou stabilité à travers l’âge. Les résultats de nos analyses sont présentés sous forme de trois articles scientifiques, qui se sont appuyés sur les données de l'Enquête santé réalisée en 2010 dans l'Observatoire de Population de Ouagadougou (OPO) et de la World Health Survey réalisée en 2002-2004 par l’OMS. Dans le premier article, nous avons trouvé que la mauvaise santé perçue était fortement associée aux maladies chroniques et aux incapacités, mais pas à la dépression. L’effet des incapacités sur la mauvaise santé perçue s’intensifiait avec l’âge et avec la diminution du niveau d’éducation. Par contre, l’effet des maladies chroniques semblait diminuer avec l’âge. Aucune variation selon le sexe n’était observée dans les associations de la santé perçue avec les maladies chroniques, les incapacités et la dépression. Ces résultats suggèrent que les différentes sous-populations définies selon le niveau d'éducation et l'âge pondèrent différemment les composantes de santé dans la santé perçue à Ouagadougou. Les résultats du second article indiquaient que le genre féminin était positivement associé à des niveaux plus élevés de détérioration cognitive et de mobilité réduite. L'excès des femmes dans ces incapacités était seulement partiellement expliqué par les inégalités de genre dans l’état nutritionnel, le statut matrimonial et, dans une moindre mesure, l'éducation. Ces résultats suggèrent que l’amélioration de l'état nutritionnel et des opportunités d'éducation à travers le cycle de vie pourrait prévenir la détérioration cognitive et la mobilité réduite et réduire partiellement l'excès féminin dans ces incapacités. Dans le troisième article, nous avons montré que le manque d'éducation était positivement associé à des niveaux plus élevés d'incapacités, et le différentiel d’état de santé fonctionnel entre les différents niveaux d'éducation restait stable à travers l'âge. Ces résultats suggèrent qu’en Afrique subsaharienne, comparativement aux individus hautement éduqués, les personnes faiblement éduquées ont moins de ressources économiques et sociales et de saines habitudes de vie qui ont des effets bénéfiques, constants sur la santé fonctionnelle selon l’âge.},

However, there is little causal evidence that speaks to this theory. Using a rich data set on the entire population of Norway over an extended period of time, we examine the effects of family size and birth order on the educational attainment of children. We find a negative correlation between family size and children's education, but when we include indicators for birth order or use twin births as an instrument, family size effects become negligible. In addition, higher birth order has a significant and large negative effect on children's education. We also study adult earnings, employment, and teenage childbearing and find strong evidence for birth order effects with these outcomes, particularly among women. These findings suggest the need to revisit economic models of fertility and child “production,” focusing not only on differences across families but differences within families as well.},

In most non-OECD countries, declining fertility rates will cause labor-force-to-population ratios to rise as the shrinking share of young people will more than offset the skewing of adults toward the older ages.

To ensure the effectiveness of such measures, scholars have advocated for continued monitoring of healthy working-life expectancy. However, estimates are limited to a few countries during limited periods of time. Our study aims to estimate healthy and unhealthy working-life expectancy in 14 OECD countries at three points in time between 2002 and 2017. Methods In this population-based study, we used cross-sectional data from nationally representative surveys on ageing that were representative of the population aged 51–65 years in England, the USA, and 11 European countries plus Israel. European countries, except for England, and Israel were divided into two groups according to their score on the Active Ageing Index (AAI). We estimated healthy and unhealthy working-life expectancy, defined as the number of years spent working in good or in poor health. Poor health was defined as the presence of at least one chronic disease. Sullivan's method was used to estimate expectancies. Findings Among men, healthy working-life expectancy increased in low-AAI countries (4·15 in 2002, 95\% CI 4·01–4·30; vs 4·73 in 2017, 4·58–4·87; p¡0·0001), but decreased in the USA (3·68 in 2002, 3·47–3·89; vs 3·21 in 2017, 3·03–3·38; p¡0·0001). Among women, healthy working-life expectancy increased in England (3·55 in 2002, 3·39–3·71; vs 4·47 in 2017, 4·14–4·81; p¡0·0001), high-AAI countries (4·16 in 2002, 4·02–4·30; vs 4·80 in 2017, 4·65–4·96; p¡0·0001), and low-AAI countries (2·41 in 2002, 2·30–2·52; vs 4·00 in 2017, 3·88–4·12; p¡0·0001). Unhealthy working life expectancy increased among men and women in all countries. In all countries, the greatest number of years spent unhealthy and working was among men and women with hypertension or arthritis. Interpretation Across countries, increases in the total number of years spent working were systematically accompanied by increases in the number of years spent working with a chronic disease. The burden of chronic diseases will probably continue to increase among older workers as countries plan to further increase their pension ages, but prevention of hypertension and arthritis could mitigate this trend.

The burden of chronic diseases will probably continue to increase among older workers as countries plan to further increase their pension ages, but prevention of hypertension and arthritis could mitigate this trend.

  abstract = {In order to counteract the effects of population aging, greater labour force participation of older adults is desired in many economically developed countries. Health, however, tends to deteriorate with age, which can become an obstacle for higher participation. Using data on objective measures of physical health from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and two of its sister studies, we examine the link between age, labour force participation and health at older ages. For this purpose we present a series of heat maps. We find that the form of the link between health and labour force participation is relatively constant between countries and over time, and is robust to the choice of the health measure. In two countries (or groups of countries) studied, over a period of about seven years, the people who contributed the most to the increase in participation rates were those in poorer health. We discuss this development against a background of changes in pension programs, particularly those targeting disabled people.},

Le fait que la santé se détériore avec l’âge pourrait cependant constituer un frein à une augmentation des taux de participation. Nous examinons, à l’aide de cartes thermiques, le lien entre santé et participation au marché du travail aux âges avancés en utilisant des données sur des mesures objectives de santé physique produites dans le cadre de la Health and Retirement Study (HRS) et ses études soeurs. Nous montrons que le lien entre santé et travail est relativement constant entre pays et à travers le temps, et est robuste au choix de la mesure de santé. Dans deux pays (ou groupes de pays) étudiés, sur une période couvrant environ sept ans, les personnes ayant contribué le plus à l’augmentation des taux d’activité sont celles en moins bonne santé. Nous discutons cette évolution sur fond de changements dans les programmes de retraite gouvernementaux, notamment ceux destinés aux personnes en incapacité de travailler.},

  abstract = {A large proportion of long-term care needs in Canada is provided in care institutions. The cost of this long-term care provision is already high and is likely to rise even more rapidly with the aging of the large baby boom cohorts. Meanwhile governments are increasingly attempting to contain these costs by encouraging home care support. In this context it is very difficult to forecast the size of the population residing in institutional care settings. In this article we present the projection derived from the LifePaths microsimulation model. On the basis of a probability of institutionalization which remains constant over the period, the model forecasts a quadrupling of numbers in care institutions between 2011 and 2051. Given the political context, there is reason to doubt whether this will actually be achieved. We discuss a number of scenarios for reducing the numbers of those living in institutional care settings, with forecasts assuming that a certain proportion of those living in institutions are transferred to home care support. We show the bases on which the selection of such individuals could be made, including a combination of characteristics such as age, level of education, marital status and number of close relatives surviving. Finally, we offer an estimate of the rise in numbers of those forecast to be living at home with severe disabilities, which could increase by 67~\% over the 2011-20151 period, assuming that the numbers of those in institutional care settings remain constant over time.},

Ces soins sont associés à des coûts importants, lesquels risquent d’augmenter encore plus rapidement avec l’avancée en âge des membres des cohortes nombreuses du baby-boom. Cependant, les gouvernements font de plus en plus d’efforts pour contenir ces coûts en favorisant le soutien à domicile. Cette situation rend le fait de projeter la population vivant en institution de santé très difficile. Nous présentons dans cet article la projection faite par le modèle de microsimulation LifePaths. Cette projection est faite en supposant le risque d’institutionnalisation constant dans le temps et prévoit un quadruplement des effectifs pendant la période 2011-2051. Étant donné le contexte politique, nous doutons qu’une telle augmentation se réalise. Nous proposons différents scénarios de réduction du nombre de personnes vivant en institution de santé. Les projections tiennent alors compte du transfert d’un certain nombre de personnes vivant en institution vers la population en ménage privé. Nous montrons comment ces personnes peuvent être choisies sur la base de certaines combinaisons de caractéristiques telles l’âge, le niveau de scolarité, le statut matrimonial et le nombre de proches survivants. Enfin, nous quantifions l’augmentation du nombre de personnes projetées comme vivant en ménage privé avec incapacité grave, qui pourrait être accrue de 67~pour cent pendant la période 2011-2051 si l’on suppose que le nombre de personnes vivant en institution de santé reste constant dans le temps.},

  abstract = {This paper offers a reappraisal of the impact of migration on economic growth for 22 OECD countries between 1986-2006 and relies on a unique data set we compiled that allows us to distinguish net migration of the native- and foreign-born populations by skill level. Specifically, after introducing migration in an augmented Solow-Swan model, we estimate a dynamic panel model using a system of generalized method of moments (SYS-GMM) to address the risk of endogeneity bias in the migration variables. Two important findings emerge from our analysis. First, there exists a positive impact of migrants’ human capital on GDP per capita, and second, a permanent increase in migration ows has a positive effect on productivity growth. However, the growth impact of immigration is small even in countries that have highly selective migration policies.},

  abstract = {This book examines health trajectories and health transitions at different stages of the life course, including childhood, adulthood and later life. It provides findings that assess the role of biological and social transitions on health status over time. The essays examine a wide range of health issues, including the consequences of military service on body mass index, childhood obesity and cardiovascular health, socio-economic inequalities in preventive health care use, depression and anxiety during the child rearing period, health trajectories and transitions in people with cystic fibrosis and oral health over the life course. The book addresses theoretical, empirical and methodological issues as well as examines different national contexts, which help to identify factors of vulnerability and potential resources that support resilience available for specific groups and/or populations. Health reflects the ability of individuals to adapt to their social environment. This book analyzes health as a dynamic experience. It examines how different aspects of individual health unfold over time as a result of aging but also in relation to changing socioeconomic conditions. It also offers readers potential insights into public policies that affect the health status of a population.},

  abstract = {This book examines health trajectories and health transitions at different stages of the life course, including childhood, adulthood and later life. It provides findings that assess the role of biological and social transitions on health status over time. The essays examine a wide range of health issues, including the consequences of military service on body mass index, childhood obesity and cardiovascular health, socio-economic inequalities in preventive health care use, depression and anxiety during the child rearing period, health trajectories and transitions in people with cystic fibrosis and oral health over the life course. The book addresses theoretical, empirical and methodological issues as well as examines different national contexts, which help to identify factors of vulnerability and potential resources that support resilience available for specific groups and/or populations. Health reflects the ability of individuals to adapt to their social environment. This book analyzes health as a dynamic experience. It examines how different aspects of individual health unfold over time as a result of aging but also in relation to changing socioeconomic conditions. It also offers readers potential insights into public policies that affect the health status of a population.},

With Canada’s population living longer, along with the anticipated shortage of Canadian workers in the coming decades and the erosion of private sector pensions, the Canadian Institute of Actuaries (CIA) believes that it is time for federal, provincial, and territorial governments to refresh their approach to helping Canadians achieve retirement income security. Canada’s retirement income security system is a complex set of interconnected arrangements, including programs funded by individuals, employers, and taxpayers. While there are many possible ways to fine-tune these arrangements, we believe that governments should consider updating retirement ages to reflect the fact that Canadians are already choosing to work past age 65 and the expectation that this trend will increase in the coming years. The CIA wants all parties to understand that later retirement is a reasonable response to longer life expectancies, worker shortages, and lower interest rates. Adjusting retirement ages will foster a growing Canadian economy — we believe Canadian workers need to be nudged in this direction.},

  abstract = {Africa is poised on the edge of a potential takeoff to sustained economic growth. This takeoff can be abetted by a demographic dividend from the changes in population age structure. Declines in child mortality, followed by declines in fertility, produce a 'bulge' generation and a large number of working age people, giving a boost to the economy. In the short run lower fertility leads to lower youth dependency rates and greater female labor force participation outside the home. Smaller family sizes also mean more resources to invest in the health and education per child boosting worker productivity. In the long run increased life spans from health improvements mean that this large, high-earning cohort will also want to save for retirement, creating higher savings and investments, leading to further productivity gains. Two things are required for the demographic dividend to generate an African economic takeoff. The first is to speed up the fertility decline that is currently slow or stalled in many countries. The second is economic policies that take advantage of the opportunity offered by demography. While demographic change can produce more, and high quality, workers, this potential workforce needs to be productively employed if Africa is to reap the dividend. However, once underway, the relationship between demographic change and human development works in both directions, creating a virtuous cycle that can accelerate fertility decline, social development, and economic growth. Empirical evidence points to three key factors for speeding the fertility transition: child health, female education, and women's empowerment, particularly through access to family planning. Harnessing the dividend requires job creation for the large youth cohorts entering working age, and encouraging foreign investment until domestic savings and investment increase. The appropriate mix of policies in each country depends on their stage of the demographic transition.},

  abstract = {This article uses 1990 census data to study the effects of immigrant inflows on occupation‐specific labor market outcomes. I find that intercity mobility rates of natives and earlier immigrants are insensitive to immigrant inflows. However, occupation‐specific wages and employment rates are systematically lower in cities with higher relative supplies of workers in a given occupation. The results imply that immigrant inflows over the 1980s reduced wages and employment rates of low‐skilled natives in traditional gateway cities like Miami and Los Angeles by 1–3 percentage points.},

  abstract = {Using data from the Current Population Survey, this paper describes the effect of the Mariel Boatlift of 1980 on the Miami labor market. The Mariel immigrants increased the Miami labor force by 7\%, and the percentage increase in labor supply to less-skilled occupations and industries was even greater because most of the immigrants were relatively unskilled. Nevertheless, the Mariel influx appears to have had virtually no effect on the wages or unemployment rates of less-skilled workers, even among Cubans who had immigrated earlier. The author suggests that the ability of Miami's labor market to rapidly absorb the Mariel immigrants was largely owing to its adjustment to other large waves of immigrants in the two decades before the Mariel Boatlift.}

  abstract = {We review Immigration Economics by George J. Borjas, published in 2014 by Harvard University Press. The book is written as a graduate-level textbook, and summarizes and updates many of Borjas's important contributions to the field over the past thirty years. A key message of the book is that immigration poses significant costs to many members of the host-country labor market. Though the theoretical and econometric approaches presented in the book will be very useful for students and specialists in the field, we argue that the book presents a one-sided view of immigration, with little or no attention to the growing body of work that offers a more nuanced picture of how immigrants fit into the host-country market and affect native workers.},

En revanche, depuis la seconde guerre mondiale, alors que la démographie a beaucoup progressé, au point de changer de visage, peu d’efforts ont été faits pour offrir une vue synthétique complète de la discipline, de ses méthodes et de ses résultats. C’est pourquoi un travail de longue haleine a été entrepris à partir du milieu des années 1990, visant à rédiger un traité de démographie qui, tout en partant du noyau dur de la discipline (l’analyse des mécanismes qui participent à la dynamique des populations), puisse rendre pleinement compte aussi bien de la recherche des déterminants biologiques, économiques et socioculturels que de l’évaluation des conséquences économiques, sociales, politiques des évolutions passées et de l’ampleur du défi que représentent les changements à venir pour l’évolution de nos sociétés. Près de 150 auteurs ont été conviés à participer à ce vaste ouvrage, intitulé Démographie : analyse et synthèse, qui comporte 143 chapitres rassemblés en 8 volumes},

  abstract = {À l’ère du web 2.0, l’usage des sites web se multiplie et génère de nouveaux enjeux. La satisfaction en rapport à l’interactivité, facteur d’efficacité des sites, détermine la popularité, et donc la visibilité de ceux-ci sur la Toile. Par conséquent, dans cette étude, nous considérons que les utilisateurs ont un rôle à jouer lors du processus de conception de ces derniers. Certes, autant en théorie que dans la pratique, les concepteurs semblent bel et bien tenir compte des utilisateurs; toutefois, ils ne les intègrent pas comme participants actifs dans leurs démarches. Cette étude vise au moyen d’une recherche documentaire et d’observations sur le terrain à comprendre les principales catégories et morphologies des sites web ainsi que les usages qui en découlent. Une analyse des diverses démarches de conception et des perceptions et attentes des internautes est réalisée sur la base de ces résultats. Pour répondre à ces objectifs, cette analyse cible deux catégories de sites réalisés par des professionnels et par des amateurs. Celle-ci nous permet de démontrer que les résultats de chacune de ces démarches, exprimés à travers les interfaces graphiques des sites, diffèrent au niveau de la qualité perceptible. Cette étude souligne également l’importance d’un traitement efficace de la communication graphique des éléments des sites web, afin de structurer la lecture et transmettre au final un message clair et compréhensible aux internautes. Dans le but consolider nos propositions, nous faisons référence à deux théories de communication graphique, la Gestalt et la sémiotique, l’une s’intéressant à la perception visuelle, l’autre à l’interprétation des signes. Celles-ci se sont révélées pertinentes pour analyser la qualité et l’efficacité des éléments de contenus. Notre étude révèle que les participants ne sont pas satisfaits des deux sites testés car l’utilisabilité du site conçu par des professionnels est trop complexe et l’interface du site conçu par un amateur manque de professionnalisme et de cohérence. Ces résultats soulignent la pertinence d’une approche centrée sur l’utilisateur pour la conception de sites web, car elle permet d’identifier et de résoudre des erreurs de conception. Nos résultats permettent également de souligner que les professionnels ayant un savoir technique et théorique se démarquent des amateurs au niveau des intervenants, des outils et des limites. Des pistes de solution, via des critères de design centré sur l’utilisateur, sont proposées à la fin de cette étude dans le but d’optimiser la qualité et l’efficacité des interfaces graphiques web.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study is to use both static and dynamic frameworks to compare the benefits that immigrants draw from the public system with their contributions through the taxes that they pay. The main conclusion of this paper is that the impact of immigration on welfare systems is weak. Thus, if we compare, on a given date, immigrants' global contribution to the public administration budget with the volume of transfers they receive, immigrants appear to be relatively favoured by the redistribution system. At the same time, even if immigrants seem to pay less taxes and receive more transfers than natives, the difference in distribution between the two populations, with a higher concentration of immigrants in the active age groups and a sparser concentration among the net beneficiaries of the social transfer system, leads to a slightly positive long-term impact of immigration on public finances. However, the impact of immigration remains very slight compared with the global effort that would have to be undertaken to reduce budgetary imbalances.},

  abstract = {We use data from the Canadian 2-year longitudinal Labour Market Activity Survey of 1986-87 to estimate the effect of the Unemployment Insurance (UI) system on job duration. Particular attention is focused on the "entrance requirements" of the UI system, which relate eligibility for UI benefits to an individual's recent employment history. The article makes operational the UI entrance requirement provisions which take into account variations in the regional unemployment rate. Controlling for many personal and job characteristics, we find evidence that a significant number of jobs terminate when they have reached the duration that would permit a UI claim.},

  abstract = {The transition to adulthood is often viewed as a period where young people move by stages into adult roles. The years after age 18 offer an opportunity for young people to become increasingly independent from their parents. During this period of transition, young people make a wide range of choices about where and with whom they live, how they will pursue their studies, what type of work they are interested in and whether or not they will get married and have children. In recent years, social scientists have found that the transition to adulthood is taking longer to complete. Young people are living with their parents longer,1 are more highly educated and attend school for more years than their parents did. The age at marriage has been rising, fertility rates have been falling and the age at which women have their first child has been increasing This article explores the transitions that young people make on their way to adulthood. Using census data from 1971 to 2001, it documents how the timing of transitions has changed and been delayed. It profiles the young adult population aged 18 to 34 and examines the five transitions that many young people make on their way to adulthood: leaving school, leaving their parents’ home, having full-year full-time work, entering conjugal relationships and having children},

A Mincerian regression framework is extended to include GDP per capita in an immigrant’s country of birth as a proxy for the quality of schooling and work experience acquired in that country. We find that Canadian immigrants’ returns to schooling and work experience significantly increase with the GDP per capita of their country of birth. The contribution of quality of schooling and work experience to the immigrant wage gap is also examined. Lower human capital quality completely negates the endowment advantage that immigrants have in the areas of schooling and work experience. Since data on GDP per capita are available for most countries over long periods, the proposed methodology can be applied to analyze immigrant wage gaps for a large set of countries for which common statistics on natives and immigrants are available.},

  abstract = {This paper quantitatively assesses the interaction between permanent immigration into France and France's macroeconomic performance as seen through its GDP per capita and its unemployment rate. It takes advantage of a new database where immigration is measured by the flow of newly-issued long-term residence permits, categorized by both the nationality of the immigrant and the reason the permit was issued. Using a VAR model estimation of monthly data over the period 1994-2008, we find that immigration flow significantly responds to France's macroeconomic performance: positively to the country's GDP per capita and negatively to its unemployment rate. At the same time, we find that immigration itself increases France's GDP per capita, particularly in the case of family immigration. This family immigration also reduces the country's unemployment rate, especially when the families come from developing countries.

  abstract = {This paper shows that the macroeconomic and fiscal consequences of international migration are positive for OECD countries, and suggests that international migration produces a demographic dividend by increasing the share of the workforce within the population. The estimation of a structural vector autoregressive model on a panel of 19 OECD countries over the period 1980–2015 reveals that a migration shock increases GDP per capita through a positive effect on both the ratio of working-age to total population and the employment rate. International migration also improves the fiscal balance by reducing the per capita transfers paid by the government and per capita old-age public spending. To rationalize these findings, an original theoretical framework is developed. This framework highlights the roles of both the demographic structure and intergenerational public transfers and shows that migration is beneficial to host economies characterized by aging populations and large public sectors.},

  abstract = {This paper aims to evaluate the economic and fiscal effects of inflows of asylum seekers into Western Europe from 1985 to 2015. It relies on an empirical methodology that is widely used to estimate the macroeconomic effects of structural shocks and policies. It shows that inflows of asylum seekers do not deteriorate host countries’ economic performance or fiscal balance because the increase in public spending induced by asylum seekers is more than compensated for by an increase in tax revenues net of transfers. As asylum seekers become permanent residents, their macroeconomic impacts become positive. We use an econometric model to show that asylum seekers do not deteriorate host countries’ economic performance or fiscal balance. We use an econometric model to show that asylum seekers do not deteriorate host countries’ economic performance or fiscal balance.},

In contrast to prior studies that predict dramatic employment declines, we find that investments in robotics are associated with increases in total firm employment but decreases in the total number of managers. Similarly, we find that robots are associated with an increase in the span of control for supervisors remaining within the organization. We also provide evidence that robot adoption is not motivated by the desire to reduce labor costs but is instead related to improving product and service quality. Our findings are consistent with the notion that robots reduce variance in production processes, diminishing the need for managers to monitor worker activities to ensure production quality. As additional evidence, we also find that robot investments predict improved performance measurement and increased adoption of incentive pay based on individual employee performance. With respect to changes in skill composition within the organization, robots predict decreases in employment for middle-skilled workers but increases in employment for low- and high-skilled workers. We also find that robots predict not only changes in employment but also corresponding adaptations in organizational structure. Robot investments are associated with both centralization and decentralization of decision-making authority depending on the task, but decision rights in either case are reassigned away from the managerial level of the hierarchy. Overall, our results suggest that robots have distinct and profound effects on employment and organizations that require fundamental changes in firm practices and organizational design.

  abstract = {In this survey, we argue that the economic analysis of fertility has entered a new era. First-generation models of fertility choice were designed to account for two empirical regularities that, in the past, held both across countries and across families in a given country: a negative relationship between income and fertility, and another negative relationship between women's labor force participation and fertility. The economics of fertility has entered a new era because these stylized facts no longer universally hold. In high-income countries, the income-fertility relationship has flattened and in some cases reversed, and the cross-country relationship between women's labor force participation and fertility is now positive. We summarize these new facts and describe new models that are designed to address them. The common theme of these new theories is that they view factors that determine the compatibility of women's career and family goals as key drivers of fertility. We highlight four factors that facilitate combining a career with a family: family policy, cooperative fathers, favorable social norms, and flexible labor markets. We also review other recent developments in the literature, and we point out promising new directions for future research on the economics of fertility.},

  abstract = {Immigration, as a source of population growth, is traditionally associated, by neoclassical economics, with negative output and growth effects for the host economy in per capita terms. This paper explores how different these effects can be when the human capital brought in by immigrants upon arrival is explicitly considered in a Solow growth model augmented by human capital and migration. The main finding is that the negative output and growth effects of immigration tend to become less important the higher the imported immigrants' human capital relative to natives. In order to evaluate the order of magnitude of these effects, descriptive evidence, based on education data, and econometric evidence, based upon the estimation of the transition equation in the augmented Solow model, is provided for a set of OECD economies during the period 1960-1985. Because of their human capital content, migration inflows are shown to have less than half the negative impact of comparable natural population increases.},

We propose an original microsimulation method to identify the components of the drift observed between 1992 and 2000 in the health expenditure age profile. On the one hand, we find empirical evidence of health improvement at a given age: changes in morbidity induce a downward drift of the profile. On the other hand, the drift due to changes in practices is upward and sizeable. Detailed analysis attributes most of this drift to technological innovation. After applying our results at the macroeconomic level, we find that the rise in health care expenditures due to ageing is relatively small. The impact of changes in practices is 3.8 times larger. Furthermore, changes in morbidity induce savings which more than offset the increase in spending due to population ageing.},

  abstract = {One of developing Asia’s foremost structural economic challenges is the need to rebalance demand and growth toward domestic sources in the face of one of its most signi cant structural shifts—the demographic transition to an older population. The scope for investment-led growth may be quite limited, so the key to growth is stronger domestic demand, and the key to stronger domestic demand is greater consumption. We examined the impact of the old-age dependency ratio on the share of consumption in the gross domestic products of 31 developing Asian economies and 122 from outside the region from 1998 to 2007. In addition, we tested for a possible difference in its effect in the Asian economies relative to the rest of the sample. The analysis suggests a positive relationship between population aging and consumption though evidence for developing Asia was weaker than that for the rest of the sample. This implies that the aging population may not be contributing as signi cantly to robust consumption and domestic demand as it does in the rest of the world. In order to rebalance their economies, developing Asian governments must therefore continue to pursue a wide range of policies to promote stronger domestic demand.},

  abstract = {Population aging, accelerating as the Baby Boom generations age, will have important fiscal consequences because expenditures on social security, Medicare, and institutional Medicaid make up more than a third of the federal budget. However, the projected fiscal pressures are far in the future, and long-term projections are very unreliable. Our analysis here has two goals: to examine the fiscal impact of population aging, and to do this in a probabilistic setting. We find that the old age dependency ratio is virtually certain to rise by more than 50\% through the 2030s, and will probably continue to increase after 2050, possibly by a great deal. Under current program structures, population aging would be virtually certain to increase the costliness of Federal programs as a share of GDP by 35 percent (±2 percent) by the 2030s, and by 60 percent (±15 percent) in the second half of the century. We project Federal expenditures (excluding interest payments and pre-funded programs) to rise from 16 percent of GDP in 2000 to 30 percent in 2075, almost doubling, while state and local expenditures rise only modestly relative to GDP. Almost all of this increase is for programs going primarily to the elderly, which rise from 8 percent of GDP in 1999 to 21 percent of GDP in 2075, due mainly to costs of health care for the elderly, with pensions a distant second. We expect that governments will respond to these aging-induced cost changes by altering program structures, so that these conditional projections will not be realized. Looking at social security, we find that raising the payroll tax rate by 1.89 percent would have relatively little effect on the probabilities of early exhaustion, raising the 2.5 percent bound for the exhaustion date from 2024 to 2036, but raising the median date of exhaustion from 2036 to 2070, and with a 55 percent chance of insolvency within the 75 year horizon. Looking at Medicare, which now costs 2.2 percent of GDP, we project a median share in 2075 of 11 percent, five times as great, with a 95 percent probability interval at 5 percent to 26 percent of GDP. Thus there is a 97.5 percent chance that the ratio will at least double, and a 2.5 percent chance that it will increase at least twelve-fold. Although the future is highly uncertain in many respects, unforeseen demographic or economic change will almost certainly not avert the long-run fiscal crunch. Changing demographic realities will require some combination of substantial tax increases or substantial benefit cuts, or other forms of restructuring.},

  abstract = {Population aging, accelerating as the Baby Boom generations age, will have important fiscal consequences because expenditures on social security, Medicare, and institutional Medicaid make up more than a third of the federal budget. However, the projected fiscal pressures are far in the future, and long-term projections are very unreliable. Our analysis here has two goals: to examine the fiscal impact of population aging, and to do this in a probabilistic setting. We find that the old age dependency ratio is virtually certain to rise by more than 50\% through the 2030s, and will probably continue to increase after 2050, possibly by a great deal. Under current program structures, population aging would be virtually certain to increase the costliness of Federal programs as a share of GDP by 35 percent (±2 percent) by the 2030s, and by 60 percent (±15 percent) in the second half of the century. We project Federal expenditures (excluding interest payments and pre-funded programs) to rise from 16 percent of GDP in 2000 to 30 percent in 2075, almost doubling, while state and local expenditures rise only modestly relative to GDP. Almost all of this increase is for programs going primarily to the elderly, which rise from 8 percent of GDP in 1999 to 21 percent of GDP in 2075, due mainly to costs of health care for the elderly, with pensions a distant second. We expect that governments will respond to these aging-induced cost changes by altering program structures, so that these conditional projections will not be realized. Looking at social security, we find that raising the payroll tax rate by 1.89 percent would have relatively little effect on the probabilities of early exhaustion, raising the 2.5 percent bound for the exhaustion date from 2024 to 2036, but raising the median date of exhaustion from 2036 to 2070, and with a 55 percent chance of insolvency within the 75 year horizon. Looking at Medicare, which now costs 2.2 percent of GDP, we project a median share in 2075 of 11 percent, five times as great, with a 95 percent probability interval at 5 percent to 26 percent of GDP. Thus there is a 97.5 percent chance that the ratio will at least double, and a 2.5 percent chance that it will increase at least twelve-fold. Although the future is highly uncertain in many respects, unforeseen demographic or economic change will almost certainly not avert the long-run fiscal crunch. Changing demographic realities will require some combination of substantial tax increases or substantial benefit cuts, or other forms of restructuring.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the effects on aggregate consumption of changes in the age distribution of the population are analysed empirically. Economic theories predict that age influences individuals' saving and consumption behaviour. Despite this, age structure effects are rarely controlled for in empirical consumption functions. Our findings suggest that they should. By analysing Norwegian quarterly time series data, we find that changes in the age distribution of the population have significant and life-cycle-consistent effects on aggregate consumption. Furthermore, controlling for age structure effects stabilises the other parameters of the consumption function and reveals significant real interest rate effects.},

The scope for investment-led growth may be quite limited, so the key to growth is stronger domestic demand, and the key to stronger domestic demand is greater consumption. We examined the impact of the old-age dependency ratio on the share of consumption in the gross domestic products of 31 developing Asian economies and 122 from outside the region from 1998 to 2007. In addition, we tested for a possible difference in its effect in the Asian economies relative to the rest of the sample. The analysis suggests a positive relationship between population aging and consumption though evidence for developing Asia was weaker than that for the rest of the sample. This implies that the aging population may not be contributing as significantly to robust consumption and domestic demand as it does in the rest of the world.

  abstract = {Cluster randomized trials (CRTs) randomize participants in groups, rather than as individuals and are key tools used to assess interventions in health research where treatment contamination is likely or if individual randomization is not feasible. Two potential major pitfalls exist regarding CRTs, namely handling missing data and not accounting for clustering in the primary analysis. The aim of this review was to evaluate approaches for handling missing data and statistical analysis with respect to the primary outcome in CRTs. We systematically searched for CRTs published between August 2013 and July 2014 using PubMed, Web of Science, and PsycINFO. For each trial, two independent reviewers assessed the extent of the missing data and method(s) used for handling missing data in the primary and sensitivity analyses. We evaluated the primary analysis and determined whether it was at the cluster or individual level. Of the 86 included CRTs, 80 (93\&nbsp;\%) trials reported some missing outcome data. Of those reporting missing data, the median percent of individuals with a missing outcome was 19\&nbsp;\% (range 0.5 to 90\&nbsp;\%). The most common way to handle missing data in the primary analysis was complete case analysis (44, 55\&nbsp;\%), whereas 18 (22\&nbsp;\%) used mixed models, six (8\&nbsp;\%) used single imputation, four (5\&nbsp;\%) used unweighted generalized estimating equations, and two (2\&nbsp;\%) used multiple imputation. Fourteen (16\&nbsp;\%) trials reported a sensitivity analysis for missing data, but most assumed the same missing data mechanism as in the primary analysis. Overall, 67 (78\&nbsp;\%) trials accounted for clustering in the primary analysis. High rates of missing outcome data are present in the majority of CRTs, yet handling missing data in practice remains suboptimal. Researchers and applied statisticians should carry out appropriate missing data methods, which are valid under plausible assumptions in order to increase statistical power in trials and reduce the possibility of bias. Sensitivity analysis should be performed, with weakened assumptions regarding the missing data mechanism to explore the robustness of results reported in the primary analysis.},

Il cherche plus spécifiquement à savoir jusqu’à quel point la génération X constitue une génération sacrifiée, comme l’ont laissé entendre nombre d’observateurs au cours des années 1980 et 1990. L’analyse montre que, si toutes les générations ont été touchées d’une manière ou d’une autre par les mutations économiques des dernières décennies, la génération X semble avoir, plus que toute autre cohorte, cumulé de multiples désavantages sur le marché du travail. Non seulement a-t-elle connu d’importantes difficultés d’insertion professionnelle, mais elle a aussi été la pionnière d’un nouveau modèle de travail ainsi que d’un nouveau cycle de vie professionnelle.},

S’appuyant sur des données d’enquête récoltées entre 1981 et 2006, il examine plus spécifiquement l’évolution de la valeur accordée au travail et de la signification du travail au sein de cette génération et en regard des autres générations. Il montre que, contrairement aux thèses défendues par plusieurs sociologues de la jeunesse au cours des années 1980 et 1990, l’orientation au travail des membres de la génération X se distingue assez peu de celle des autres générations. Il conclut que les difficultés économiques rencontrées de manière toute particulière par les membres de la génération X au moment de leur insertion professionnelle n’ont pas modifié, de manière durable et typique, leur orientation au travail.},

Il ne s’agit pas de discuter de l’argumentaire économique sous-jacent à cette injonction, mais plutôt de discuter de quelques transformations récentes qui, selon certains auteurs, justifieraient le prolongement de la vie professionnelle des individus.},

Alors que la mortalité chez les hommes et les retraites involontaires chez les femmes étaient les principales sources d’années de travail perdues avant 65 ans dans les premières années étudiées, la chute de l’âge effectif de la retraite observée jusqu’au milieu des années 1990 était par contre principalement alimentée par les retraites volontaires. Ces départs volontaires sont aussi responsables du report de la retraite constaté dans les vingt dernières années. Dans l’éventualité où les décideurs publics plancheraient sur de nouvelles politiques touchant la retraite, les résultats obtenus dans cette analyse montrent qu’il est important de tenir compte de la prépondérance des facteurs qui incitent les travailleuses et travailleurs canadiens à quitter le marché de l’emploi en fin de carrière.}

Alors que la mortalité chez les hommes et les retraites involontaires chez les femmes étaient les principales sources d’années de travail perdues avant 65 ans dans les premières années étudiées, la chute de l’âge effectif de la retraite observée jusqu’au milieu des années 1990 était par contre principalement alimentée par les retraites volontaires. Ces départs volontaires sont aussi responsables du report de la retraite constaté dans les vingt dernières années. Dans l’éventualité où les décideurs publics plancheraient sur de nouvelles politiques touchant la retraite, les résultats obtenus dans cette analyse montrent qu’il est important de tenir compte de la prépondérance des facteurs qui incitent les travailleuses et travailleurs canadiens à quitter le marché de l’emploi en fin de carrière.}

  abstract = {L’article porte sur un changement radical, mis en œuvre à partir d’instrumentations locales consacrées à l’amélioration opérationnelle. Pour analyser ce changement, les auteurs ont mobilisé la théorie de l’activité. L’outil n’est rien hors de l’activité~; tel est l’axiome central de cette théorie qui trouve ses origines dans l’œuvre scientifique de Lev Vygotski (1934/1985). Plus précisément le texte s’appuie sur l’approche proposée par Engeström (1987) qui a appliqué les idées de Vygotski à l’étude de la communication au travail et des interactions entre différents systèmes d’activité. L’application de ce cadre d’analyse montre que ce type de changement, ayant une forte composante artefactuelle et culturelle, peut être analysé en considérant l’interaction entre le système d’activité d’«~amélioration opérationnelle~», qui porte une intention de changement fondée sur des instruments, et le système d’activité managérial. Il apparaît que le changement au sein de l’organisation se produit à travers des apprentissages situés, liés aux tensions entre systèmes d’activité. La recherche met également en avant le rôle central de l’objet du système d’activité, comme pouvant faire le lien entre la nature à la fois locale et globale du changement organisationnel.},

This study examines the relative effect of historical and social class location on engagement in consumerism within two different cohorts of retired people in the United Kingdom.Methods. With use of self-reported data from the retired members of a nationally representative survey, an index of consumption was constructed. Its internal reliability was analysed and analyses of variance performed to examine the impact of class of origin, cohort, and class at exit on levels of self-reported “consumerism.”Results. The index demonstrated sufficient internal reliability to provide an operational measurement of “consumerism” within this retired population. Analyses of variance confirmed that class at exit and cohort but not class of origin contributed significantly to variation in levels of consumerism. These effects were not mediated by cohort differences in health.Discussion. Occupational standing immediately before retirement was associated with “consumerism” after retirement. This is unsurprising. The results also show that birth cohort exercised a stronger historical influence on current consumption in later life than did class background (i.e., paternal social class). This supports our thesis that the limited but increasing immersion in mass consumer society of successive cohorts who were born and grew up earlier in the 20th century continues to be reflected in levels of “consumerism” in retirement.},

L'objectif de ce rapport est double. Dans un premier temps, il s'agit de préciser les questions auxquelles nous sommes confrontés. Dans un deuxième temps, nous cherchons à répondre à ces questions en examinant les données empiriques disponibles. Premièrement, à partir principalement d'une analyse de statistiques descriptives, nous concluons que rien ne porte à croire que, de façon générale, le Canada est aux prises avec une pénurie de main-d'oeuvre qualifiée ou que la main-d'œuvre canadienne ne peut pas satisfaire aux exigences de l'économie. Deuxièmement, l'étude de données microéconomiques révèle une fréquence accrue de pénuries précises de main-d'œuvre dans certains secteurs et pour diverses professions au cours des dernières années. Toutefois, il ne semble pas que ces pénuries constituent un phénomène plus répandu aujourd'hui que dans le passé à des stades semblables du cycle économique. Nous concluons donc que, s'il y a une pénurie grandissante de main-d'œuvre (qualifiée et peu qualifiée), il n'y a pas de pénurie généralisée de main-d'oeuvre qualifiée. Troisièmement, il ressort de l'examen des données disponibles que le Canada se compare avantageusement à plusieurs de ses principaux compétiteurs sur les marchés mondiaux, tant sur le plan des investissements en capital humain que sur celui du stock des compétences. Finalement, nous examinons aussi les niveaux de compétence minimums nécessaires pour réussir sur le marché du travail canadien.

The goal of this paper is two fold. We will first identify the issues confronting us, and then seek to resolve them by examining the available empirical data. First, by drawing principally on an analysis of descriptive statistics, we conclude that there is no reason to believe that, globally, Canada is suffering from a broad-based shortage of skilled labour or that its workforce cannot fulfil the economy's needs. Second, examination of microeconomic data reveals an increased frequency of specific labour shortages in certain sectors and occupations in recent years. Nonetheless, it does not appear that these shortages are more common today than they were in the past at similar stages of the business cycle. We conclude that, while there may be a growing labour shortage (skilled and low-skilled), there is no aggregate shortage of skilled labour. Third, available data indicate that Canada compares favourably with many of its principal competitors in world markets, both in terms of investments in human capital and in the stock of skills. Finally, we investigate the minimum skill level necessary for success on the Canadian labour market.

We next provide a quantitative assessment of the consequences of the demographic transition by projecting Quebec’s budgetary balance until 2056. A problem of fiscal sustainability is quickly identified. We then examine how sensitive the projection results are to demographic and economic assumptions. Finally, we explore the significance of assuming that health expenditures in the last year of life are several times larger than for survivors. Under this alternative assumption, health spending decreases by a small, but significant, amount in the long run.},

In this paper, we look at the role that population aging plays in increasing economic inequality. We provide estimates of the magnitudes of the effects on inequality of three different factors related to population aging: capital intensification, changing population age structure, and increasing longevity. Changing age structure is found to have a small effect on aggregate inequality, while capital deepening and longevity-based life cycle savings are shown to be more important. Taken together, our findings suggest that aging has a substantial effect on economic inequality., Special issue on Health, education and retirement over the prolonged life cycle},

Later that year, Mohsen Javdani and Krishna Pendakur from the economics department at Simon Fraser University (J\&P hereafter) presented an alternative estimate of this fiscal burden of \$450. This study concludes that J\&P’s lower estimate is due mainly to their choice of a different immigrant cohort and assumptions about the immigrants’ absorption of government spending on pure public goods, education, and public housing. After taking into account some new data and some issues raised by J\&P, this study presents new estimates that show that the fiscal burden imposed by the average recent immigrants is \$6,000, which for all immigrants is a total of between \$16 billion and \$23 billion per year, figures virtually identical to those found in our earlier study. This study also rejects arguments made by J\&P that immigrants are needed to meet labour shortages, that they bring productivity-increasing economies of scale, and that their children will repay the fiscal burden. New evidence does not provide any grounds for optimism that the offspring of recent immigrants are going to be able to earn enough to compensate current and future generations of Canadians for the fiscal transfers made to their parents by existing Canadians. This study also presents new evidence showing that immigrants who were admitted mainly on the basis of pre-arranged jobs have superior economic performance, which supports the policy recommendation made in our 2011 study.},

  abstract = {The Current Population Survey (CPS) has been the source of official labor force statistics for the U.S. since its inception in March 1940. The best-known statistic calculated from CPS data is the unemployment rate. To be classified as unemployed, a person must have had no employment during the survey reference week, been available for work, and made specific efforts to find employment during the 4-week period ending with the reference week. The unemployment rate represents the number unemployed as a percent of the labor force. The unemployment rate has proven to be a reliable indicator of overall labor market conditions and has performed quite well as a business cycle indicator. That does not mean, however, that everyone has been completely satisfied with the official figures. As a result, in the 1970s, a range of unemployment indicators known as U-1 through U-7 was introduced. In 1994, a redesigned CPS was fielded, and some of the survey changes affected series used as inputs in several of the U-1—U-7 measures. Consequently, BLS introduced a new set of “U’s” in 1995. The new U-1—U-6 range of alternative measures of labor underutilization offered an updated set of indicators that took advantage of newly collected information in the redesigned survey. This paper summarizes the rationale for the original and current ranges of alternative indicators. The paper also concludes that while the five alternatives to the official unemployment rate in the current U-1—U-6 range may represent varying views of labor resource underutilization, they show very similar patterns of change across the course of the business cycle.},

Even though it focuses on the CPP, most of its analysis applies to the QPP as well since the two programs are largely identical. This paper does not provide a broad survey of all possible reform options, but rather analyzes one vital option that has received insufficient attention in previous debates: raising the normal retirement age from 65 to 67 years. A discussion of this option is warranted not only because it could prevent future financing problems in Canada’s public pension insurance programs, but also because it could improve fairness across generations. The significant increase in life expectancy raises the question of whether the current retirement ages of 60 years, for earliest CPP and QPP benefits, and 65 years, for full benefits, are too low. Should future generations pay for the longevity increases of the current generation of workers, or should current workers share the costs by retiring at a later age? We conclude that raising the normal age from 65 to 67 years—and the earliest age from 60 to 62 years—is a financially effective, intergenerationally fair, and politically acceptable option for improving the CPP and for addressing the QPP’s problems. We suggest that the option of raising the retirement age needs to be discussed well before longevity increases or funding problems occur and that a broad consultation with stakeholders and citizens would be an essential part of a debate on raising the retirement age in Canada.},

Delaying work-retirement transitions by five years would have large, positive economic and fiscal effects, reducing pressures on growth, government finances and pension funding. While there is no immediate crisis to be addressed, a key reform will be to gradually increase the standard age of pension eligibility in order to bring it more in line with increases in longevity. Such reforms should involve gradually raising the age band at which one could receive C/QPP. Similar changes to the Old Age Security (OAS) would provide consistency in signals about retirement ages.}

  abstract = {This chapter outlines the positions in the current debate about the possibility of using public policies to influence fertility. We note the polarization between, on the one hand, those who view public policies as obvious means for lifting the currently low fertility levels in Europe, in line with the role of economic policies in a modern society; and, on the other hand, those who feel that family policies are inefficient, and perhaps even unnecessary. We place the contributions of the national chapters of this book in this framework and describe the formidable methodological difficulties that face those who seek to investigate policy impacts on fertility behavior. While properly conducted empirical investigations have overcome such problems and have clearly demonstrated policy effects in specific circumstances, we conclude that, in general, national fertility is possibly best seen as a systemic outcome that depends more on broader attributes, such as the degree of family-friendliness of a society, and less on the presence and detailed construction of monetary benefits.},

Classically, count data follow a Poisson distribution; however, in practice such data often display greater heterogeneity in the form of excess zeros (zero-inflation) or greater spread in the values (overdispersion) or both.

  abstract = {Based on surveys of members of the National Association of Forensic Economics (NAFE), the predominant method for calculating worklife expectancy involves the use of Markov process statistical work- life expectancy tables, with the LPE method as a distant second, use of a fixed retirement date as a close third, and with median or mean years to final labor force separation a distant fourth. However, no paper has specifically addressed the reasons why the majority of forensic economists (or at least a majority of those completing NAFE surveys) apparently feel that statistical worklife tables compiled by standard Markov process models are superior to calculations based on the LPE version of Markov process models. A statement arguing that the LPE method is superior to standard statistical worklife expectancy tables has been published by Michael Brookshire and George Barrett (2009). This paper evaluates the claims made by Brookshire and Barrett, and explains why standard versions of Markov Process tables will usually be more accurate than the LPE version of the Markov process model when used in developing estimates of work-life expectancy for specific individuals.},

  abstract = {Based on surveys of members of the National Association of Forensic Economics (NAFE), the predominant method for calculating worklife expectancy involves the use of Markov process statistical work- life expectancy tables, with the LPE method as a distant second, use of a fixed retirement date as a close third, and with median or mean years to final labor force separation a distant fourth. However, no paper has specifically addressed the reasons why the majority of forensic economists (or at least a majority of those completing NAFE surveys) apparently feel that statistical worklife tables compiled by standard Markov process models are superior to calculations based on the LPE version of Markov process models. A statement arguing that the LPE method is superior to standard statistical worklife expectancy tables has been published by Michael Brookshire and George Barrett (2009). This paper evaluates the claims made by Brookshire and Barrett, and explains why standard versions of Markov Process tables will usually be more accurate than the LPE version of the Markov process model when used in developing estimates of work-life expectancy for specific individuals.},

De la littérature portant sur la longévité et la mortalité aux grands âges, un constat émerge : bien que les déterminants associés à la survie humaine soient multiples, l'environnement familial aurait un rôle déterminant sur la mortalité et sur l'atteinte des âges avancés. Dès lors, l'objectif de cette thèse est d'évaluer les déterminants de la survie exceptionnelle et d'examiner le rôle des aspects familiaux, en début de vie et à l'âge adulte, dans les différentiels de durée de vie. Plus spécifiquement, elle vise à : (1) examiner la similarité des âges au décès entre frères, soeurs et conjoints afin d'apprécier l'ampleur de la composante familiale de la longévité; (2) explorer, d'un point de vue intrafamilial, les conséquences à long terme sur la survie des variables non partagées issues de la petite enfance tels l'âge maternel à la reproduction, le rang de naissance et la saison de naissance; et (3) s'interroger sur le rôle protecteur ou délétère de l’environnement et du milieu familial d'origine dans l’enfance sur l'atteinte des grands âges et dans quelle mesure le statut socioéconomique parvient à médiatiser la relation. Cette analyse s'appuie sur le jumelage des recensements canadiens et des actes de décès de l’état civil québécois et emploie des données québécoises du 20e siècle issues de deux échantillons distincts : un échantillon aléatoire représentatif de la population provenant du recensement canadien de 1901 ainsi qu’un échantillon de frères et soeurs de centenaires québécois appartenant à la même cohorte. Les résultats, présentés sous forme d'articles scientifiques, ont montré, en outre, que les frères et soeurs de centenaires vivent plus longtemps que les individus appartenant aux mêmes cohortes de naissance, reflétant la contribution d'une robustesse commune, mais également celle de l'environnement partagé durant la petite enfance. Ces analyses ont également témoigné d'un avantage de survie des conjoints des centenaires, soulignant l'importance d'un même environnement à l'âge adulte (1er article). De plus, nos travaux ont mis de l'avant la contribution aux inégalités de longévité des variables biodémographiques issues de l'environnement non partagé telles que l'âge maternel à la reproduction, le rang de naissance et la saison de naissance, qui agissent et interagissent entre elles pour créer des vulnérabilités et influer sur l'atteinte des âges exceptionnels (2e article). Enfin, une approche longitudinale a permis de souligner la contribution du milieu social d'origine sur la longévité, alors que les individus issus d’un milieu socioéconomique défavorisé pour l'époque (milieu urbain, père ouvrier) vivent moins longtemps que ceux ayant vécu dans un environnement socioéconomique favorable (milieu rural, fermier), résultat d'une potentielle accumulation des avantages liée à la reproduction du statut social ou d'une programmation précoce des trajectoires de santé. L’influence est toutefois moindre pour les femmes et pour les frères de centenaires et s'exprime, dans ce cas, en partie par l'effet de la profession à l'âge adulte (3e article).},

  abstract = {Though the university discipline of gerontology has existed for half a century, it still lacks proper recognition. Admittedly, it concerns old people who are themselves often seen in a negative light. In our society, the word «ageing» is spontaneously associated with something that is outmoded, declining or obsolete. It is only in the last ten years that ageing has been treated as a normal and positive phase of life. Despite this important and recent development, this young discipline still suffers from a major handicap. From the outset it has always been dominated by an empirical approach. Gerontologists collect large amounts of data but produce few theories. Indeed, the first scientists to take an interest in this field used the methods and theoretical notions of their original disciplines without really constituting a new theoretical corpus specific to this area. In social gerontology, the theory of modernization and ageing is one of the rare theories to seek an explanation for the process of change. It examines the impact of developments in society and postulates that industrialization and urbanization have a negative impact on the status of old people and on the support they receive. Though refuted, this theory still holds sway among public opinion and is used to interpret certain current trends, such as the increasing demand for residential care or the growing number of old people living alone. This absence of theory is regrettable as it prevents us from establishing conceptual frameworks to take account of demographic change and to adapt the organization of society accordingly. To analyse the ageing process, gerontologists must focus on three general points. The first task is to define what we mean by an old person. Secondly, the evolutive aspects of ageing must be analysed from all angles (biological, psychological, social) and thirdly, the way in which social organization takes account of ageing must be examined. © La Documentation française.},

It sought to bring about a revolution, commonly referred to as the ‘Keynesian Revolution’, in the way economists thought—especially challenging the proposition that a market economy tends naturally to restore itself to full employment on its own. Regarded widely as the cornerstone of Keynesian thought, this book challenged the established classical economics and introduced new concepts. ‘The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money’ transformed economics and changed the face of modern macroeconomics. Keynes’ argument is based on the idea that the level of employment is not determined by the price of labour, but by the spending of money. It gave way to an entirely new approach where employment, inflation and the market economy are concerned.},

Furthermore, scarce research considers the role of control over work hours in the context of worker underemployment. Using unique data and measures constructed from a nationally representative survey of the 2006 and 2016 US General Social Survey, we find that being part-time underemployed is concentrated toward workers who are minority, lower income, and employed in certain service occupations. Multivariate analysis reveals that, relative to both part-time workers satisfied with their hours and to full-time workers, the part-time underemployed endure significantly greater risks of facing lower financial status and financial dis-satisfaction. Part-time underemployed workers also experience more frequent work-to-family conflict, compared to other part-time workers, and no less than otherwise comparable full-time workers. Their elevated work-family conflict is intensified when having limited control over their work hours. We derive implications of these findings for preventative public policies that would help curb both the extent and the harms of underemployment, recently rendered even more necessary by its rise during the 2020 recession.}

  abstract = {RésuméLa démographie historique semble avoir pris un tournant « micro » en se concentrant de plus en plus sur l’analyse des parcours de vie. Si l’on suit ses avocats, il ne s’agit de rien moins que d’un nouveau paradigme de la démographie (historique). Cet article propose une vue critique de cette affirmation, en examinant les succès en termes de recherche et en discutant les obstacles potentiels à la réussite des promesses de cette nouvelle approche.L’adoption de l’analyse des parcours de vie a déjà fourni des contributions très neuves par rapport aux sujets ignorés de la démographie historique traditionnelle (les orphelins, le service domestique dans le cycle de vie, les études comparées sur les dynamiques familiales). Des sujets comme le vieillissement, les migrations et la fécondité ont également bénéficié de la collecte et de l’analyse des données du parcours de vie.En dépit de ces avancées, le développement de cette approche peut être compromis par plusieurs facteurs : le concept lui-même, les méthodes statistiques utilisées et les pratiques de recherches dominantes ainsi que l’attraction de notre champ. Tout d’abord l’affirmation de la capacité d’organiser sa propre vie est d’application difficile dans les recherches historiques. Néanmoins, l’ignorance des motifs et des buts des individus ne devrait pas dissuader d’identifier quels étaient les plus probables dans certains lieux et certaines périodes. Ensuite, la méthode de l’« event history analysis » ne permet pas de clarifier les parcours de vie en tant que processus. Des modèles plus élaborés devraient permettre de préciser l’impact des expériences passées, des conduites alternatives, des interactions entre les processus et les contextes. Enfin, le coût d’apprentissage de la démographie historique risque de devenir trop élevé, en particulier si des techniques encore plus poussées doivent être utilisées. Des équipes interdisciplinaires pourraient résoudre cette difficulté. Par ailleurs, l’approche du parcours de la vie suppose des bases de données compliquées et très riches. Tout cela ne peut être accompli par les équipes universitaires traditionnelles et les chercheurs solitaires. Dans ce domaine, les pratiques de recherche (et d’apprentissage) doivent s’orienter vers le partage de données, la collaboration et l’exploitation de banques de données publiques. Finalement, afin d’attirer les chercheurs d’autres domaines, la recherche doit privilégier des questions à fort enjeu politique aujourd’hui comme le niveau de la fécondité (enjeu du remplacement), les migrations et l’intégration des populations étrangères.},

  abstract = {This paper attempts to construct some working life tables (WLTs) for females in Canada, 1971. Attention is directed to methodological problems in female WLT construction, a suggested methodology, and loss due to mortality. The working life expectancy (WLE), which refers to the average number of years that a person is likely to spend in the labor force during his/her lifetime, reveals the extent of his/her contribution to the national economy. Although working life tables have been prepared for Canadian males, no attempt has been made previously to develop a WLT for the Canadian females. In some countries, such as Canada, the long census questionnaire collects additional pieces of information on labor force participation (LFP), even though the coverage is only on a part (but sizable) of the population. It is suggested that the information on "weeks worked" (Canadian Census wording) can be used to smooth out the bimodality problem in the female LFP. If a working woman works for an entire year, i.e., 52 weeks inclusive of paid holidays and vacation, she is said to contribute 1 woman year of working (or economically active) life to the economy. On the basis of this concept of a woman year of working life, all females who are working full time, part time, and not working can be considered in regard to their respective contributions of working lives to the national economy. An age limit is not indicated in the definition. The number of hours worked per day cumulated for the year and scaled down to the base of 1 woman year of working life would make the analysis more realistic. If the census data on weeks worked are tabulated by single years of age, or age groups for the female population, the average number of weeks worked specific for the various age categories can be computed. Those who are unemployed are taken as contributing zero weeks worked in the computation of the mean. Then the age specific participation rate is obtained as the percent of the average number of weeks worked by females in a given age group to the total number of weeks in a year. From these age specific rates, the probabilities of LFP at an age interval is worked out by averaging 2 consecutive age specific rates. Employing the notion of woman years of working life and utilizing the average number of weeks worked from the 1971 Census of Canada PUST data, a set of age specific participation rates for the Canadian females was developed. With these participation rates, the WLT for the Canadian females is constructed. The WLE for a female in Canada in 1971 attains a maximum of 38.7 years at age 15 and declines with increases in age. A comparison with the males showed that the female WLE was higher in the latter and lower in the early years of life.},

  journaltitle = {SSRN Electronic Journal},
  doi = {10.2139/ssrn.2875076},
  abstract = {In this paper, we provide a basic overview of the welfare and pension income security options available to workers who are (or have been) on the move (OTM) in Canada. Workers on the move, for the purposes of this paper, include: (a) a Canadian or permanent resident worker who is working and living temporarily outside of their usual or current province of residence; (b) a Canadian or permanent resident worker who has recently worked and lived temporarily outside of their current province of residence; (c) a temporary foreign worker (TFW) who was employed under a valid work permit; (d) an undocumented worker who has worked without a valid work permit. We look at the legislative frameworks and the limited academic literature that address the eligibility for and practical access to income security benefits for such workers. This paper is divided into three parts: access to welfare benefits; access to public pensions (i.e. Old Age Security (OAS), Guaranteed Income Supplement (GIS) and the Canada and Quebec Pension Plans (CPP/QPP); and, finally, access to private pensions. In each section, we summarize eligibility issues for different categories of OTM workers in a table and, when appropriate, offer a breakdown of provincial-specific information for Newfoundland and Labrador, Quebec, Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia. Academic literature on this topic is nearly nonexistent, so our presentation and analysis remains rather technical. Overall, our conclusions are that, while immigration status makes TFWs and undocumented workers ineligible for some of these income security measures (a fact that may lead them into extreme financial hardship), the fact of a worker being “on the move” does not in and of itself seem to be a significant barrier to access. And while empirical research conducted by other members of the OTM team may uncover examples of mobile workers having difficulty accessing welfare or pensions in practice because of their mobile work trajectories or because of their lack of knowledge about their entitlement to these benefits, our research does not suggest that there are significant policy barriers related to being on the move.},

  abstract = {The term adverse selection is used in the insurance literature to describe a situation where an individual’s demand for insurance (either the propensity to buy insurance, or the quantity purchased, or both) is positively correlated with the individual’s risk of loss (e.g. higher risks buy more insurance), and the insurer is unable to allow for this correlation in the price of insurance. This may be because of private information known only to the individual, or because of regulations or social norms which prevent the insurer from using certain categories of known information to differentiate prices (e.g. the insurer may be prohibited from using information such as gender or ethnic origin or genetic tests). To test for the presence of adverse selection one checks the conjecture that contracts with more comprehensive coverage are chosen by agents with higher accident risk.},

This may be because of private information known only to the individual, or because of regulations or social norms which prevent the insurer from using certain categories of known information to differentiate prices (e.g. the insurer may be prohibited from using information such as gender or ethnic origin or genetic tests).

Using data from the 2006 and 2008 Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging organised by the Korea Labor Institute (KLI), we find that the elderly poverty rate between 2006 and 2008 decreased significantly but was still significantly higher than that of other OECD countries. This poverty reduction did not benefit individuals who were older, less educated, living alone, living in rural areas, or in poor health.

Study design This is a population-based longitudinal study. Methods Data came from the Understanding America Study, a population-based panel in the United States. Between April and May 2020, 3548 adults who were not out of the labor force were surveyed. Analyses using targeted maximum likelihood estimation examined the association of employment insecurity with depression, assessed using the 2-item Patient Health Questionnaire, and anxiety, measured with the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale. Stratified models were evaluated to examine whether employment insecurity and its mental health consequences are disproportionately concentrated among specific social groups. Results Being unemployed or underemployed was associated with increased odds of having depression (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.66, 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.36–2.02) and anxiety (AOR = 1.50, 95\% CI = 1.26, 1.79), relative to having a full-time job. Employment insecurity was disproportionately concentrated among Hispanics (54.3\%), Blacks (60.6\%), women (55.9\%), young adults (aged 18–29 years; 57.0\%), and those without a college degree (62.7\%). Furthermore, Hispanic workers, subsequent to employment insecurity, experienced worse effects on depression (AOR = 2.08, 95\% CI = 1.28, 3.40) and anxiety (AOR = 1.95, 95\% CI = 1.24, 3.09). Those who completed high school or less reported worse depression subsequent to employment insecurity (AOR = 2.44, 95\% CI = 1.55, 3.85). Conclusions Both unemployment and underemployment threaten mental health during the pandemic, and the mental health repercussions are not felt equally across the population. Employment insecurity during the pandemic should be considered an important public health concern that may exacerbate pre-existing mental health disparities during and after the pandemic.}

Certaines études surestiment les bénéfices d'une croissance démographique rapide, en mettant l'accent sur les coûts des retraites, tout en excluant la dépendance due aux enfants; d'autres surestiment les coûts dans la mesure où elles supposent que les enfants prennent des décisions de façon autonome. Lorsque l'on envisage les enfants comme membres du ménage, les effets de la répartition par âge paraissent moins importants. Dans tous les cas, une croissance démographique plus rapide abaisse le capital par travailleur et, donc, le revenu par tête; il semble que cet effet de croissance domine les effets de la répartition par âge. /// This paper offers an analytic synthesis and critique of recent literature exploring the role of age structure in models of steady state economic growth. Some studies overstate the benefits of rapid population growth by focusing on pension costs to the exclusion of child dependency; others overestimate the costs because they treat children as autonomous decision makers. When children are viewed as household members, the effects of age distribution appear smaller. In any case, more rapid population growth depresses capital per worker and therefore per capita income; this effect of growth appears to dominate the age distribution effects., Démographie économique}

On the contrary, full employment remains the key to solving the social ills of the industrialized countries and can still be attained with the right package of international and national policies.},

Underdeveloped public transfer programmes are at the centre of heated political debates, and a better understanding of economic well-being and the relation between public and private transfers will provide further insights in evaluating policy reform proposals under consideration. Using data from the 2006 and 2008 Korean Longitudinal Study of Aging organised by the Korea Labor Institute (KLI), we find that the elderly poverty rate between 2006 and 2008 decreased significantly but was still significantly higher than that of other OECD countries. This poverty reduction did not benefit individuals who were older, less educated, living alone, living in rural areas, or in poor health. We find that low-income elderly who co-reside depend almost completely on the income of their children or other household members. Public transfers account for no more than a third of income for low-income elderly, while private transfers account for half. Our analysis suggests that crowding-out is not a real concern in increasing welfare transfers for the low-income elderly.},

  abstract = {Longer lives and fertility far below the replacement level of 2.1 births per woman are leading to rapid population aging in many countries. Many observers are concerned that aging will adversely affect public finances and standards of living. Analysis of newly available National Transfer Accounts data for 40 countries shows that fertility well above replacement would typically be most beneficial for government budgets. However, fertility near replacement would be most beneficial for standards of living when the analysis includes the effects of age structure on families as well as governments. And fertility below replacement would maximize per capita consumption when the cost of providing capital for a growing labor force is taken into account. Although low fertility will indeed challenge government programs and very low fertility undermines living standards, we find that moderately low fertility and population decline favor the broader material standard of living.},

  abstract = {Resources are reallocated across age and time by means of capital accumulation, credit transactions, and transfers. Each takes place through three channels: the family, financial markets, and public sector programs. These age-specific flows give rise to stocks of age-specific wealth. Weighting by population age distribution and summing yields aggregate wealth, which equals capital plus transfer wealth; the aggregate credit balance must be zero. Forms of aggregate wealth are related to properties of the macroeconomy. A framework is developed for relating flows to stocks. Flows and stocks for the United States in 1987 are analyzed by applying this framework to the 1987 CES. For example, the average household has about 100K in federal transfer wealth, a debt of 15K in state/local wealth, and a debt of 10K in interhousehold family transfers., Special Issue: The Family and Intergenerational Relations},

Using Canadian censuses from 1971 to 2006, we calculate measures of their income and wealth at various (active) ages and compare both indicators of affluence to those of their ‘parents’ (cohorts born 30 years before) at the same ages. In both provinces, the baby boomers are much richer than their parents: in historical perspective, their economic situation just before retirement is not a great concern, except for a few special cases, analysed separately in the chapter.},

Changes in marriage behaviors may entail or reflect profound changes in family organization, gender relations and fertility and, to the extent that consensual unions are relatively transitory and lead to more sexual partners, they may be associated with greater sexual risks including HIV. The determinants of new unions being consensual are estimated from national family-life type survey data that provide information on the timing of different types of marriages and the start of cohabitation. While consensual unions are not new to the country, they appear to be changing in nature and have been growing more common over time especially in urban areas. They are also more popular among men and women with greater schooling or who began cohabiting while living outside the country, and for women who have previously lived in union.},

  abstract = {Depuis plusieurs décennies, des études empiriques réalisées sur plusieurs pays développés ou en émergence ont montré que la baisse de la taille de la famille favorise l’investissement dans l’éducation des enfants, expliquant qu’un nombre élevé d’enfants a un effet d’amenuisement des ressources familiales. Les retombées positives de la baisse de la fécondité sur l’éducation sont largement étudiées et connues. En dépit des résultats controversés des premières études portant sur les pays de l’Afrique de l’Ouest, les récentes études empiriques tendent à confirmer l’effet positif de la baisse de la taille de la famille dans le contexte africain, du moins en milieu urbain. Par contre, jusqu’à présent, très peu d’études semblent intéressées à analyser la répartition de ces retombées entre les enfants, et encore moins à comprendre comment ces dernières affecteraient la structure des inégalités éducatives existantes. Notre étude s’intéresse à explorer la potentielle dimension démographique des inégalités socioéconomiques, notamment les inégalités éducatives dans le contexte de la baisse de la fécondité. Elle vise à apporter des évidences empiriques sur le lien entre la réduction de la taille de la famille et les inégalités éducatives au sein des ménages dans le contexte d’Ouagadougou, Capitale du Burkina Faso, qui connait depuis quelques décennies la chute de la fécondité. Elle analyse aussi l’effet de cette réduction sur la transmission intergénérationnelle des désavantages éducatifs. Pour ce faire, nous proposons un cadre conceptuel pour comprendre les mécanismes par lesquels la relation entre la réduction de la taille de la famille et les inégalités éducatives se tisse. Ce cadre conceptuel s’appuie sur une recension des écrits de divers auteurs à ce sujet. Par la suite, nous procédons à des analyses empiriques permettant de tester ces liens en utilisant les données du projet Demtrend collectées. Les résultats empiriques sont présentés sous forme d’articles scientifiques. Les conclusions du premier article indiquent que la relation entre le nombre d’enfants de la famille et l’éducation varie selon le contexte socioéconomique. En effet, pour les générations qui ont grandi dans un contexte socioéconomique colonial et postcolonial, où le mode de production était essentiellement agricole et l’éducation formelle n’était pas encore valorisée sur le marché du travail, la relation est très faible et positive. Par contre, pour les récentes générations, nous avons observé que la relation devient négative et fortement significative. De plus, les résultats de cet article suggèrent aussi que la famille d’origine des femmes a une incidence significative sur leur comportement de fécondité. Les femmes dont la mère avait un niveau de scolarité élevé (et étaient de statut socioéconomique aisé) ont moins d’enfants comparativement à celles dont leurs parents avaient un faible niveau de scolarité (et pauvres). En retour, leurs enfants sont aussi les plus éduqués. Ce qui sous-tend à un éventuel effet de levier de la réduction de la taille de la famille dans le processus de transmission intergénérationnelle des désavantages éducatifs. Le second article fait une comparaison entre les ménages de grande taille et ceux de petite taille en matière d’inégalités éducatives entre les enfants au sein des ménages familiaux, en considérant le sexe, l’ordre de naissance et les termes d’interaction entre ces deux variables. Les résultats de cet article montrent que généralement les enfants des familles de petite taille sont plus scolarisés et atteignent un niveau d’éducation plus élevé que ceux des grandes familles. Toutefois, les filles ainées des petites familles s’avèrent moins éduquées que leurs pairs. Ce déficit persiste après avoir considéré seulement les ménages familiaux monogames ou encore après le contrôle de la composition de la fratrie. L’émancipation des femmes sur le marché du travail résultant de la réduction de la taille de la famille et la faible contribution des pères dans les activités domestiques expliqueraient en partie cette situation. Malheureusement, nous n’avons pas pu contrôler l’activité économique des mères dans les analyses. Finalement, dans le cadre du troisième et dernier article, nous avons examiné l’effet d’avoir été confié par le passé sur les inégalités éducatives au sein de la fratrie, en comparant ceux qui ont été confiés aux autres membres de leur fratrie qui n’ont jamais été confiés. Dans cet article, nous avons considéré l’aspect hétérogène du confiage en le différenciant selon le sexe, la relation de la mère avec le chef du ménage d’accueil et l’âge auquel l’enfant a été confié. Les résultats montrent qu’avoir été confié dans le passé influence négativement le parcours scolaire des enfants. Cependant, cet effet négatif reste fort et significatif que pour les filles qui ont été confiées après leurs 10 ans d’âge. Un profil qui correspond à la demande de main-d’œuvre en milieu urbain pour l’accomplissement des tâches domestiques, surtout dans le contexte de la baisse de la taille de la famille et l’émancipation des femmes sur le marché du travail.},

Until recent times, no reliable statistics were available for the analysis of fertility behaviours, which were treated rather as a question of philosophy, morals, political science or religion.

At that time, the demographic transition in Europe and the accompanying social and economic transformations gave rise to new demographic behaviours for which a theoretical framework was needed. Many new disciplines were brought into play, including anthropology, sociology, economics, political science and psychology. Paradoxically, demographers were slow to develop theoretical approaches, doubtless because the discipline first made its name as a quantitative science. Indeed, no overarching, generally acknowledged theory of fertility has yet been developed. These different approaches are illustrated through a series of pioneering texts.

As a consequence, the success of this method in biology has nothing to do with the alleged similarity of the way it operates with biological processes but with choices of parameters in accordance with the kind of materials and questions biologists are facing. As materials and questions differ in social sciences, it is not possible to import OM directly from biology.

  abstract = {This paper uses an OLG-CGE model for the UK to illustrate the long-term effect of migration on the economy. We use the current Conservative Party migration target to reduce net migration “from hundreds of thousands to tens of thousands” as an illustration. Achieving this target would require reducing recent net migration numbers by a factor of about 2. We undertake a simulation exercise to compare a baseline scenario, which incorporates the principal 2010-based ONS population projections, with a lower migration scenario, which assumes that net migration is reduced by around 50 per cent. The results show that such a significant reduction in net migration has strong negative effects on the economy. By 2060 the levels of both GDP and GDP per person fall by 11.0 per cent and 2.7 per cent respectively. Moreover, this policy has a significant impact on public finances. To keep the government budget balanced, the effective labour income tax rate has to be increased by 2.2 percentage points in the lower migration scenario.},

  abstract = {© The Author(s) 2015. Objective: The aim of the article is to analyze past and present developments of working life expectancy (WLE) at age 50 by age, sex, and education in Europe. WLE is also compared with life expectancy (LE) and healthy life expectancy (HLE). Method: WLE is calculated with the Sullivan method. Labor force participation is based on the European Union (EU) Labor Force Survey. Results: WLE at age 50 has been increasing since the mid- to late 1990s in most European countries. Increases were more pronounced among women than men. Differences in WLE by education are substantial. The comparison of WLE, LE, and HLE for the year 2009 reveals that the correlation between WLE and LE is smaller than between WLE and HLE. Discussion: The analysis of trends in WLE at age 50, particularly when set in relation to remaining LE, provides useful insights about the development of the distribution of economically active and inactive years in Europe's aging societies.},

  abstract = {© The Author(s) 2015. Objective: The aim of the article is to analyze past and present developments of working life expectancy (WLE) at age 50 by age, sex, and education in Europe. WLE is also compared with life expectancy (LE) and healthy life expectancy (HLE). Method: WLE is calculated with the Sullivan method. Labor force participation is based on the European Union (EU) Labor Force Survey. Results: WLE at age 50 has been increasing since the mid- to late 1990s in most European countries. Increases were more pronounced among women than men. Differences in WLE by education are substantial. The comparison of WLE, LE, and HLE for the year 2009 reveals that the correlation between WLE and LE is smaller than between WLE and HLE.

  abstract = {While large government deficits and debt raise concerns regarding intergenerational fairness, their longterm intergenerational impacts can significantly differ, depending on demographic shifts and future economic policy. In particular, population aging in Canada has accelerated during the past decade due to declining fertility and improving life expectancy. This demographic transition poses new fiscal challenges since it dampens growth in government revenue while putting pressure on government spending, particularly in healthcare and public pensions. Generational accounting is a powerful tool for assessing the lifetime fiscal burden on current and future generations, given demographic and economic projections. The method requires estimating the present value of government’s current and future net revenues to cover all current and future spending plus net debt. A large imbalance between the net tax burden faced by current and future generations over their lifetimes, in favor of current generations, would mean that existing fiscal policies are unfair and unsustainable. Using generational accounting, this Commentary shows that the projected lifetime fiscal burdens of the youngest generation (born since 2005) and future generations are very high: higher than those of any other generations, especially those born from the mid-1950s to the 1990s. Generally speaking, babyboomers and their children fare well in this scenario, but the grandkids of babyboomers do not. Looking to the future, we also specifically compare the prospective net tax burden faced by today’s newborns with those that will be faced by future generations. Here, the results are less troubling. We find future generations of Canadians are expected to face a slightly lower lifetime tax burden than newborns, implying relative intergenerational balance looking out into the future.

  abstract = {While large government deficits and debt raise concerns regarding intergenerational fairness, their longterm intergenerational impacts can significantly differ, depending on demographic shifts and future economic policy. In particular, population aging in Canada has accelerated during the past decade due to declining fertility and improving life expectancy. This demographic transition poses new fiscal challenges since it dampens growth in government revenue while putting pressure on government spending, particularly in healthcare and public pensions. Generational accounting is a powerful tool for assessing the lifetime fiscal burden on current and future generations, given demographic and economic projections. The method requires estimating the present value of government’s current and future net revenues to cover all current and future spending plus net debt. A large imbalance between the net tax burden faced by current and future generations over their lifetimes, in favor of current generations, would mean that existing fiscal policies are unfair and unsustainable. Using generational accounting, this Commentary shows that the projected lifetime fiscal burdens of the youngest generation (born since 2005) and future generations are very high: higher than those of any other generations, especially those born from the mid-1950s to the 1990s. Generally speaking, babyboomers and their children fare well in this scenario, but the grandkids of babyboomers do not. Looking to the future, we also specifically compare the prospective net tax burden faced by today’s newborns with those that will be faced by future generations. Here, the results are less troubling. We find future generations of Canadians are expected to face a slightly lower lifetime tax burden than newborns, implying relative intergenerational balance looking out into the future. However, small changes to the baseline scenario can make that balance tip unfavourably for future generations. For example, both higher-than-expected interest rates and lower-than-expected population growth would lead to generational imbalance by imposing higher net tax burdens on future generations. Also, failing to restrain the growth of healthcare spending below its recent experience (1996 to 2010 average) could shift the tax burden to future, unborn generations, and lead to a large and likely untenable imbalance. To ensure future intergenerational fairness and sustainability, policies that improve labour market outcomes of youth, women and immigrants, and that encourage a longer working life, should be supported.

In the context of a new demographic regime of high immigration and low fertility, differentials in labor force participation and educational attainment can be more consequential for the labor force than either the number of immigrants or structure of the overall population. OBJECTIVE The objective of this paper is to investigate how improvements in both educational attainment (especially among children with a low educated mother or an immigration background) and labor force participation (especially of women and immigrants) could impact the future labor force in the European Union. METHODS We used a microsimulation model called CEPAM-Mic to project the labor force of EU28 countries.

  abstract = {This article reviews what has been learned about the relationship between saving, investment, and economic growth in the last 30 years. It asks how important a high rate of saving is to rapid economic growth and whether rapid population growth impedes efforts to raise the rate of saving. A higher national saving rate is an important macroeconomic objective for many of today's developing countries. Foreign sources provide only a modest portion of the investment needs of all but a few. And even if foreign sources could be tapped more extensively, few countries are prepared to increase their foreign indebtedness. The experience of Japan and the United States, among other countries, demonstrates that a higher rate of investment leads to higher output per worker and a more rapid rate of economic growth over an extended period. Reduced fertility and slower population growth have contributed to the macroeconomic objective of increased saving in a number of countries. Survey evidence, international cross-sectional data, and time series studies of Asian countries support the view that slower population growth leads to higher saving. But the adverse impact of population growth on saving is by no means universal. In a number of developing countries available evidence fails to confirm the existence of a population-saving link. Moreover, both economic theory and analysis of aggregate saving data confirm that declining fertility may not lead to higher saving, particularly in countries with stagnant or slowly growing economies.},

Recent upturns in longevity have promoted policy debates over extending the retirement age in the country. However, whether observed gains in life expectancy are accompanied by improving health remains to be addressed. Using data from the 1994–2014 Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey of the Higher School of Economics, this study investigates trends over 20 years in healthy life expectancy (HLE) and illness-free life expectancy (IFLE) for men and women at adult ages. Analyses using the Sullivan method show that men and women at adult ages have experienced large increases in health expectancies during the post-Soviet period. Increases in HLE exceeded increases in total life expectancy for both genders. Further, health expectancies have evolved over time through cycles of increases and decreases, just like life expectancy. These results suggest increases in good-quality years among men and women at working ages, offering support for changing the official retirement age. The extent of the change in the retirement age, however, needs to be carefully considered, given that, despite recent improvements, the health expectancy of the Russian population still remains low.},

  abstract = {This book by William Mitchell and Joan Muysken is both important and timely. It deals with the issue of the abandonment of full employment as an objective of economic policy in the OECD countries. It argues persuasively that macroeconomic policy has been restrictive over the recent, and not so recent past, and has produced substantial open and disguised unemployment. But the authors show how a job guarantee policy can enable workers, who would otherwise be unemployed, to earn a wage and not depend on welfare support. If such a policy is fully supported by appropriate fiscal and monetary programmes, it can create full employment with price stability, which the authors label as a Non-Accelerating-Inflation-Buffer Employment Ratio (NAIBER). This book is essential reading for any one wishing to understand how we can return to full employment as the normal state of affairs. Philip Arestis, University of Cambridge, UK This book dismantles the arguments used by policy makers to justify the abandonment of full employment as a valid goal of national governments. Bill Mitchell and Joan Muysken trace the theoretical analysis of the nature and causes of unemployment over the last 150 years and argue that the shift from involuntary to natural rate conceptions of unemployment since the 1960s has driven an ideological backlash against Keynesian policy interventions. The authors contend that neo-liberal governments now consider unemployment to be an individual problem rather than a reflection of systemic policy failure and that they are content to use unemployment as a policy instrument to control inflation and coerce the unemployed with work tests and compliance programmes rather than provide sufficient employment. They present a comprehensive theoretical and empirical critique of this policy approach, with a refreshing new framework for understanding modern monetary economies. The authors show that the reinstatement of full employment with price stability is a viable policy goal that can be achieved by activist fiscal policy through the introduction of a Job Guarantee. Full Employment Abandoned will appeal to graduate and postgraduate students and researchers of economics and politics with an interest in macroeconomic policy and the labour market, particularly unemployment and neo-liberal policy frameworks.},

Yet, in many countries, including the United States, all workers face identical benefit schedules, which are a function of one's labor market history, making it difficult to separate the effect of the benefit level from the effect of unobserved preferences for work on individuals' claiming decisions. To circumvent this problem, we exploit exogenous variation in DI benefits in Austria arising from several reforms to its DI and old age pension system in the 1990s and 2000s. We use comprehensive administrative social security records data on the universe of Austrian workers to compute benefit levels under six different regimes, allowing us to identify and precisely estimate the elasticity of DI claiming with respect to benefit generosity. We find that, over this time period, a 1\% increase in potential DI benefits was associated with a 1.2\% increase in DI claiming.},

Comparativement aux Canadiens de naissance, la performance des immigrants du ROC sur le plan salarial a toujours été supérieure à celle des immigrants du Québec, et s'est constamment améliorée vis-à-vis de celle-ci. Nous montrons que le phénomène n'est pas dû au fait que les politiques d'immigration du Québec sont différentes de celles du ROC, puisque l'écart serait encore plus important si le Québec accueillait les mêmes types d'immigrants que le ROC; l'on ne peut pas non plus expliquer le phénomène par le fait que les immigrants subiraient plus de discrimination au Québec. En fait, nous observons que la différence grandissante entre l'écart salarial immigrants-Canadiens de naissance au Québec et celui dans le ROC reflète surtout l'évolution de la prime salariale dont profitent les immigrants qui obtiennent la citoyenneté canadienne (et dont ne profitent pas ceux qui ne sont que canadiens permanents); cette prime a considérablement diminué au Québec, alors qu'elle est restée stable dans le ROC au cours de la période étudiée. This paper examines the nature of the differences in the wage gap between Canadian born males and immigrant males in Quebec and in the rest of Canada (ROC) over the period 1980—2000. Relative to Canadian born individuals, immigrants in the ROC have been consistently, and increasingly, faring better in terms of wages than immigrants in Quebec. We cannot conclude that this is a consequence of Quebec having different immigration policies than the ROC, as the wage gap would be even larger if Quebec attracted the same immigrants as the ROC, nor can we conclude that immigrants are more discriminated against in Quebec. We find that the increased differential in the Quebec-ROC immigrant wage gap mostly reflects changes in the premium earned by immigrants who become citizens over those who remain landed immigrants; this premium virtually disappeared in Quebec while remaining stable in the ROC over the period.]},

It creates a new world, where the traditional morals and manners may no longer be appropriate. But not only will the new world generally not absorb all those displaced from the old; it will itself discard the moderately stabilizing market mechanisms of the older Craft-based capitalismcapitalism, and, moving into mass productionmass production(and later the information economyinformation economy), come to work in a new and more unstable way.

The transportation industry will be the first to experience the aftermath of AVs since these can kill driving professions and create new layers of employability-related social exclusion. This paper appraises public perceptions of AVs and their employment repercussions as a forecasting tool that can drive equitable policy planning that prioritises humans over machines. The study is based on an online survey of 773 responses from an international audience. Descriptive statistics and ordinal regression modelling have been used. Most respondents recognised that the arrival of AVs is likely to revolutionise the distribution of jobs within the transport industry. They also believe governments are not prepared for the transformations AVs will force upon workplace arenas. Age, field of work/study, level of understanding AVs, income, gender, awareness about the risks on own employment were factors influencing the respondents' perceptions of whether transport professionals' job security will be jeopardised. The study argues that AVs are perceived as a significant employment disruptor and that reskilling, public engagement and awareness exercises should be widely adopted by the stakeholders ‘responsible’ for the transition.}

  abstract = {The fiscal impact of immigration — how immigrants and their descendants affect government budgets — is a widely debated and contentious issue. Economists overwhelmingly accept the economic gains of immigration, but are less certain about immigrants’ impact on government budgets. Contention over this issue is fueled by the numerous methodologies and complexity of analysis that obscure the fiscal costs of immigration. The complexities are many. Each layer of the United States’ federal structure of government — federal, state, and local — is funded by different types of taxes and each spend their budgets on different programs and in different ways. The types of public goods consumed by immigrants also affect their fiscal impact. If the public goods are “pure,” meaning that they are non-rivalrous and non-excludable, then more taxpayers in the form of immigrants spread out the tax cost without diminishing the quality of the goods. Immigrants lower the tax burden of providing pure public goods. But, if the public goods are “congestible,” more immigrants could decrease the quality of the goods, prompting the government to spend more tax dollars to maintain the quality. Some congestion occurs for most government-supplied goods whenever population increases, by immigration or through procreation, but the fiscal impact varies widely. Immigrants also impact the U.S. economy. They can displace U.S.-born workers, complement them, or have little impact on their employment opportunities, all of which alter tax revenue and government welfare expenditures in different ways. Immigrants are also consumers of real estate and other goods and services in the United States, boosting aggregate demand and spurring investment that further grows the taxable economy. The methodologies employed to study the fiscal impact of immigration are also numerous and complicated. This chapter will examine these methodologies’ relative merits and demerits, and present the common findings of the major studies using the various methodologies.},

The data also contain very rich information on individual earnings throughout these individuals' entire life cycle that allows us to construct a measure of lifetime earnings. Date and cause of death are obtained from national registers. Using Cox proportional hazard models, we find an inverse relationship between parental income and mortality, also when controlling for individual lifetime income and when studying those with high education separately.

Our results show that the change in the crude labour force rate was dominated by the change in age-specific labour force participation rates.

In this study, we use qualitative data from rural and urban sites in Senegal to consider the degree to which plausible demographic hypotheses are borne out in people's discourse on reproductive decision-making. In-depth interviews with men and women are used to examine awareness and conscious reasoning about both replacement and insurance motivations, perception of mortality and other risks in relation to childbearing and the extent to which people have the agency to act upon their perceptions. The limited evidence of explicit replacement and insurance strategies suggest their impact on fertility in Wolof Senegal is small, even amongst the urban educated elite for whom costs of children in terms of money and parental time are much more important constraints.

En este estudio utilizamos datos cualitativos recogidos en zonas urbanas y rurales de Senegal para evaluar en qué medida las explicaciones de los individuos relativas a la toma de decisiones en materia reproductiva confirman las hipótesis demográficas. Entrevistas en profundidad con hombres y mujeres permiten examinar la toma de conciencia y los razonamientos conscientes relativos al reemplazo y a la seguridad, a la percepción de la mortalidad y de los otros riesgos relacionados con la procreación y a la capacidad de actuar de acuerdo a tales percepciones. La escasez de elementos en favor de la existencia de estrategias explícitas de reemplazo y seguridad, sugiere que su impacto su impacto sobre la fecundidad es débil entre los Wolofs de Senegal, aun entre la élite urbana y educada, para la cual el coste de los hijos en términos monetarios y de atención paterna son las limitaciones principales.

  abstract = {La baisse de la mortalité est susceptible de jouer un rôle important dans la transition de la fécondité. Les démographes ont souvent tenté d'expliquer la corrélation entre ces phénomènes par une "prise de décision rationnelle" des individus, un concept issu de théories développées à partir d'analyses quantitatives. Dans cette étude, nous utilisons des données qualitatives collectées en milieu urbain et rural au Sénégal afin d'évaluer dans quelle mesure les hypothèses des démographes sont confirmées par les discours qu'ont les individus sur la prise de décision en matière de reproduction. Des entretiens approfondis avec des hommes et des femmes ont permis d'examiner la prise de conscience et les raisonnements explicites au regard des motivations de remplacement et d'assurance, la perception de la mortalité et des autres risques liés à la procréation et la capacité d'agir des individus conformément à leurs perceptions. Le peu d'éléments appuyant l'existence de stratégies explicites de remplacement et d'assurance suggère leur faible impact sur la fécondité parmi les Wolofs au Sénégal, même au sein de l'élite urbaine et instruite pour qui les coûts de l'enfant en termes d'argent et d'attention parentale sont des contraintes essentielles. La mortalité des enfants n'est pas une composante majeure dans le discours portant sur la prise de décision en matière de procréation. /// Mortality decline has been assumed to play an important role in fertility transitions. Demographers often attempt to explain the correlation between these phenomena by "rational reproductive decision-making" on the part of individual actors, an idea which follows on from theories developed out of quantitative associations and analyses. In this study, we use qualitative data from rural and urban sites in Senegal to consider the degree to which plausible demographic hypotheses are borne out in people's discourse on reproductive decision-making. In-depth interviews with men and women are used to examine awareness and conscious reasoning about both replacement and insurance motivations, perception of mortality and other risks in relation to childbearing and the extent to which people have the agency to act upon their perceptions. The limited evidence of explicit replacement and insurance strategies suggest their impact on fertility in Wolof Senegal is small, even amongst the urban educated elite for whom costs of children in terms of money and parental time are much more important constraints. Child mortality is not a major component of the fertility decision-making discourse. /// La disminución de la mortalidad puede jugar un papel importante en la evolución de la fecundidad.

The present study provides data from a German cohort for over 20 years. The aim was to examine how the frequency of experiencing unemployment affects life satisfaction and whether their relationship changes over time. In the Saxon Longitudinal Study, an age-homogeneous sample was surveyed annually from 1987 to 2016. Since 1996, 355 people (54\% female) have been examined for issues related to unemployment. Life satisfaction was measured with both the Global Satisfaction with Life Scale and the Questions on Life SatisfactionModules questionnaire. In 1996, the participants were 23 years old and 50\% of the sample was affected by unemployment. At all 16 different measuring points, participants who were never unemployed indicated higher life satisfaction than those who were once unemployed. The repeatedly unemployed consistently reported the lowest values of life satisfaction. In each year, there were significant differences with small to medium effect sizes. Our results support the notion that the adverse effects of unemployment on life satisfaction increase with the time spent unemployed. In 2016, only 2\% of the cohort were currently unemployed, but differences between people with and without unemployment experience still exist. This indicates that the negative effect of the unemployment experience will last for a very long time. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that demonstrates the effect so persistently at so many measurement points for over 20 years.},

  abstract = {Population aging, accelerating as the Baby Boom generations age, will have important fiscal consequences because expenditures on social security, Medicare, and institutional Medicaid make up more than a third of the federal budget. However, the projected fiscal pressures are far in the future, and long-term projections are very unreliable. Our analysis here has two goals: to examine the fiscal impact of population aging, and to do this in a probabilistic setting. We find that the old age dependency ratio is virtually certain to rise by more than 50\% through the 2030s, and will probably continue to increase after 2050, possibly by a great deal. Under current program structures, population aging would be virtually certain to increase the costliness of Federal programs as a share of GDP by 35 percent (±2 percent) by the 2030s, and by 60 percent (±15 percent) in the second half of the century. We project Federal expenditures (excluding interest payments and pre-funded programs) to rise from 16 percent of GDP in 2000 to 30 percent in 2075, almost doubling, while state and local expenditures rise only modestly relative to GDP. Almost all of this increase is for programs going primarily to the elderly, which rise from 8 percent of GDP in 1999 to 21 percent of GDP in 2075, due mainly to costs of health care for the elderly, with pensions a distant second. We expect that governments will respond to these aging-induced cost changes by altering program structures, so that these conditional projections will not be realized. Looking at social security, we find that raising the payroll tax rate by 1.89 percent would have relatively little effect on the probabilities of early exhaustion, raising the 2.5 percent bound for the exhaustion date from 2024 to 2036, but raising the median date of exhaustion from 2036 to 2070, and with a 55 percent chance of insolvency within the 75 year horizon. Looking at Medicare, which now costs 2.2 percent of GDP, we project a median share in 2075 of 11 percent, five times as great, with a 95 percent probability interval at 5 percent to 26 percent of GDP. Thus there is a 97.5 percent chance that the ratio will at least double, and a 2.5 percent chance that it will increase at least twelve-fold. Although the future is highly uncertain in many respects, unforeseen demographic or economic change will almost certainly not avert the long-run fiscal crunch. Changing demographic realities will require some combination of substantial tax increases or substantial benefit cuts, or other forms of restructuring.},

There may be direct and indirect effects of job loss on wellbeing, and these effects may be temporary or permanent, depending on the outcome of interest. Ruhm (1991) and Jacobson et al. (1993) for example show that wage earnings – not surprisingly – decline dramatically in the event of a job loss. However, this effect is permanent in the sense that a comparable group without a job loss follows a much higher wage path in the years following the job loss. Effects on family life have also been shown: Charles and Melvin (2004) find a significant increase in divorce probability for laid-off individuals. Bono et al. (2008) show that fertility decisions are changed due to a job loss, resulting in delayed or forgone child birth. Various papers find a negative effect of job loss on health. Clearly, health is an example where an indirect effect can be imagined – through lower wages, investments in health are declining, and then overall health is affected in addition to a possible direct effect (through depressive symptoms caused by the unemployment situation, for example). Sullivan and von Wachter (2009) find an increase in mortality, Strully (2009) shows that there are effects on subjective health measures as well. Others, for example Salm (2009) or Browning et al. (2006), argue that health effects are rather spurious and not necessarily caused by the job loss. Long-term effects on health have not yet been investigated, mainly due to lack of suitable data.},

There may be direct and indirect effects of job loss on wellbeing, and these effects may be temporary or permanent, depending on the outcome of interest. Ruhm (1991) and Jacobson et al. (1993) for example show that wage earnings – not surprisingly – decline dramatically in the event of a job loss. However, this effect is permanent in the sense that a comparable group without a job loss follows a much higher wage path in the years following the job loss.

  abstract = {The composition of the U.S. population will change significantly in coming decades as the decline in fertility rates following the baby boom, coupled with increasing longevity, leads to an older population. This demographic shift will likely have a dramatic effect on the long-run prospects for living standards. Moreover, as has been widely discussed in the media and by policymakers, population aging also has significant implications for social programs for the elderly, such as Social Security and Medicare. In this paper, we discuss the consequences of population aging from a macroeconomic perspective and consider alternative paths the economy could follow in response to population aging. The choices society makes among those alternatives will be closely linked to decisions about how to reform entitlement programs for the elderly. The fundamental conclusion of our study is that, barring a significant increase in labor force participation, population aging will lead to a reduction in per capita consumption relative to a baseline in which the demographic composition of the population does not change. The size of any consumption reduction depends critically on whether the adjustment happens sooner or later and on whether the labor force participation of the elderly changes. Important policy questions, then, are whose consumption path falls, by how much, when, and by what means? Decisions about Social Security and Medicare reform are integrally bound up with these fundamental policy questions.},

A wide variety of sociological and economic forces is identified as contributing to the remarkably steady growth of women's labour force participation since the early 1950s including: the rising material aspirations of families; the development of new birth control techniques; very pronounced changes in attitudes with respect to desired family size; changes in women’s personal aspirations, as reflected in the increasing average educational attainments of women; the sharply rising incidence of marriage break-down and divorce; the expansion of the service sectors of industrialized economies; and the growth in the range of household labour-saving devices and convenience products. Notably,the largest increases in women's participation rates were recorded by women with very young children present in the home. The apparent stability of the participation rate of adult men is identified as resulting from different influences working in opposite directions; namely rising average educational attainments that operated to increase their participation and improvements in social security and other factors that worked to decrease their participation. For young persons, labour force participation patterns appear to be related to changes in the economic returns to higher education. The high monetary rewards to further education in the 1950s and 1960s were associated with declining participation rates and rising school enrollment rates; the decline in the returns to education in the 1970s was associated with declining (or more slowly rising) enrollment rates, and rising participation rates},

  abstract = {Following the era of the ‘golden age of marriage’ and the baby boom in the 1950s and 1960s, marriage has declined in importance, and its role as the main institution on which family relations are built has been eroded across Europe. Union formation most often takes place without a marriage. Family and living arrangements are currently heterogeneous across Europe, but all countries seem to be making the same shifts: towards fewer people living together as a couple, especially in marriage; an increased number of unmarried couples; more children born outside marriage; and fewer children living with their two parents. The relationship between these changing living arrangements, especially the decline of marriage, on the one hand, and the overall level of fertility, on the other, is not straightforward. In most countries, marriage rates and fertility declined simultaneously. However, the aggregate relationship between marriage and fertility indices has moved from negative (fewer marriages imply fewer births) to positive (fewer marriages imply more births). Thus, the decline of marriage, which is a part of the second demographic transition (see Overview Chapter 6), cannot be considered an important cause of the current low fertility level in many European countries. On the contrary, in European countries where the decline of marriage has been less pronounced, fertility levels are currently lower than in countries where new living arrangements have become most common.},

  abstract = {© 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany and Mathematical Optimization Society. Latent or unobserved phenomena pose a significant difficulty in data analysis as they induce complicated and confounding dependencies among a collection of observed variables. Factor analysis is a prominent multivariate statistical modeling approach that addresses this challenge by identifying the effects of (a small number of) latent variables on a set of observed variables. However, the latent variables in a factor model are purely mathematical objects that are derived from the observed phenomena, and they do not have any interpretation associated to them. A natural approach for attributing semantic information to the latent variables in a factor model is to obtain measurements of some additional plausibly useful covariates that may be related to the original set of observed variables, and to associate these auxiliary covariates to the latent variables. In this paper, we describe a systematic approach for identifying such associations. Our method is based on solving computationally tractable convex optimization problems, and it can be viewed as a generalization of the minimum-trace factor analysis procedure for fitting factor models via convex optimization. We analyze the theoretical consistency of our approach in a high-dimensional setting as well as its utility in practice via experimental demonstrations with real data.},

Factor analysis is a prominent multivariate statistical modeling approach that addresses this challenge by identifying the effects of (a small number of) latent variables on a set of observed variables. However, the latent variables in a factor model are purely mathematical objects that are derived from the observed phenomena, and they do not have any interpretation associated to them. A natural approach for attributing semantic information to the latent variables in a factor model is to obtain measurements of some additional plausibly useful covariates that may be related to the original set of observed variables, and to associate these auxiliary covariates to the latent variables. In this paper, we describe a systematic approach for identifying such associations. Our method is based on solving computationally tractable convex optimization problems, and it can be viewed as a generalization of the minimum-trace factor analysis procedure for fitting factor models via convex optimization. We analyze the theoretical consistency of our approach in a high-dimensional setting as well as its utility in practice via experimental demonstrations with real data.},

Using a sample of 4,827 couples – childless or with at least one child under 13 – from the Italian Time Use Survey (2002–2003), this chapter provides an estimate of the time cost of children in an aged society, such as Italy. In particular, it investigates how Italian couples’ time dedicated to childcare and unpaid and total work varies by presence, number, and age of children. The methodology is a loose adaptation of that used in microeconomics for the estimate of the monetary cost of children. OLS model results corroborate the hypothesis that Italian children are great time consumers. Ceteris paribus, parents’ workload increases by more than 3 h a day when there is a child under 3. Time costs increase with the number of children, albeit less than proportionally, and decrease with the age of the youngest child. Most of these costs are borne by women. The proportion of incremental child cost paid by women increases as the age of the youngest grows (up to 75\%) but usually declines with the number of children. In no case women pay less than 58\% of the child cost.},

The paper shows that with the combination of reasonable fiscal policies aimed at increasing revenues and reducing expenditures, El Salvador could cut by almost a half the hypothetical debt burden resulting from not adopting fiscal measures to affront the demographic change.

First, I provide empirical estimates of age-specific con- sumption elasticities to interest rate shocks. The consumption of young people is significantly more responsive to interest rate shocks than the old, and explains most of the aggregate response. The consumption responses are driven by homeowners who refinance or enter new loans after interest rate declines. Second, I develop a life-cycle model that explains these empirical facts. The model features fixed-rate mortgages, with fixed costs to refinance and enter into a new loan. I find that young people have a higher propensity to adjust their loans, because the fixed costs are spread over a larger loan size, relative to older individuals. Quantitatively, the loan adjustment channel accounts for a sizable share of the difference in consumption elasticities between young and old individuals. Under an older demographic structure, the model predicts a sig- nificantly lower aggregate consumption response to monetary policy shocks},

In this article, we use 1971–2014 data from the Current Population Survey to examine temporal changes in involuntary part-time work—an increasingly common type of underemployment. Our analysis identifies several shifts in involuntary part-time work, including high rates of such work among Hispanic workers since the late 1980s. While this form of underemployment grew substantially among all racial/ethnic groups during the Great Recession, it was especially prevalent among foreign-born Hispanics, in particular those without citizenship.

  abstract = {An economist analyzed 1950-1987 specific data and 1967-1988 age-specific unemployment rates from West Germany to examine the effects of relative cohort size and relative cohort age on unemployment. He used Augmented Dickey-Fuller Tests to look at stationarity for each series. Then he conducted cointegration regressions between the 2 variables if integrated at order 1. He used 4 error correction models to determine short run behavior. In the long run, high unemployment rates did not occur among young cohorts, if their cohort size was relatively high. Instead higher age cohorts were crowded out, especially the higher age cohorts of males. In fact, relative average age of the young reduced unemployment. The short run tended to be independent of the long run equilibrium conditions yet the series were cointegrated. Further the business cycle indicator explained much of the short run behavior of unemployment change. 20-24 and 25-34 year old cohorts were the most sensitive. Cohort size and age had a positive impact on unemployment in the short run, but the estimates were significant for only 6 of 14 cases for cohort size particularly male unemployment change and 2 of 14 cases for age affect (female unemployment change). The economist further remarked that German reunification oand immigration by ethnic Germans from East Europe does not change the issue of demographic aging even though former East Germans had higher fertility and East German society was less aging than that of West Germany.},

  abstract = {Using data from Demographic and Health Surveys, we examine the composition of households containing older adults in 24 countries of sub-Saharan Africa, with a focus on those living with children and grandchildren. Overall, 59 per cent live with a child and 46 per cent with a grandchild. Men are more likely to live in nuclear households and women in extended households and alone. Regression analyses show that individual-level determinants of household composition differ by sex. For example, living with children and grandchildren is tied to living with a spouse for men, but for women the effect is either not significant or in the opposite direction. Households with an older adult and a grandchild, but no adult children, are common. Usually the adult child lives elsewhere, though about 8 per cent of older adults live with a grandchild who has at least one deceased parent. Older adults are more likely to be living with double-orphans in countries with high AIDS-related mortality.},

  abstract = {Linking household composition of older persons and material well-being is an important step toward understanding quality of life among elders in less developed settings. The association is particularly important in sub-Saharan Africa, given the poverty in the region. Ordinary least square regressions using data from 23 countries examine how age composition among all households and presence of offspring and grandchildren among older person households associates with a wealth index that is based on ownership of resources and housing characteristics, and whether the association is consistent across countries. Results indicate older-person-only households, and older persons with youth, have, generally, less wealth than households with other age compositions. Among older person households, those without offspring or grandchildren and skip-generation households fare worst in most countries. Findings highlight the importance of considering older persons households when assessing material well-being and chances o...},

The aim of this paper is to examine the fiscal implications of the demographic shift using panel data on 25 EU countries in the period from 1995 until 2014. In order to qualify the findings of previous literature, this paper considers the demographic variables as endogenous and applies the system GMM estimator to obtain the elasticity of several public finance categories with respect to population aging. The results indicate significant and positive impacts of the elderly share on expenditure for pensions and social protection. The higher positive impact on overall public expenditure compared with total government revenue confirms the negative effect of population aging on budget balance.
